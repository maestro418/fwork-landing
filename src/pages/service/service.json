			"article": "Types of Blockchain Development Services\n----------------------------------------\n\nDevTeam.Space offers a comprehensive range of blockchain development services to create, test, deploy, and maintain all kinds of blockchain-based solutions.\n\nOur expert blockchain developers have helped our clients build a range of custom blockchain solutions such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain-based supply chain apps, etc. We also regularly undertake custom smart contract development, blockchain security audits, DApp development, and more.\n\nIf you want to see some of the great blockchain projects that we have completed then take a look at our blockchain case studies page.\n\nThe blockchain technologies you choose for your blockchain project will depend on your unique development requirements.\n\nYou can either outsource your complete blockchain project to our development teams or outstaff any number of blockchain developers and manage them yourself. If you wish to learn more, get a complimentary discovery call with one of our tech account managers by submitting your [project request here](https://dashboard.devteam.space/get-started/).\n\n### Top Blockchain Development Technologies Our Developers Use:\n\n1.  Ethereum\n2.  Hyperledger Fabric\n3.  R3 Corda\n4.  Stellar\n5.  Solidity\n6.  Metamask\n7.  Ganache\n8.  EOS\n9.  Binance Smart Chain\n10.  Ripple\n\nOur developers use all the major technologies to create and maintain our clients’ blockchain apps. Here are a few of their favorite tools and their benefits.\n\n#### Ethereum Blockchain Development Services\n\nEthereum is the most widely used blockchain platform for creating decentralized applications. The main advantages of undertaking Ethereum blockchain development are as follows:\n\n1.  Ethereum is a mature system that allows developers to develop and deploy blockchain applications, i.e. smart contracts. Using Solidity and Vyper, developers have created everything from supply chain solutions to NFT game cards. Ethereum’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows it to run these smart contracts. If you plan to use it, you will need a developer who knows EVM requirements back to front.\n2.  Ethereum is a large ecosystem, which means there are lots of powerful development tools and solutions out there that can help with development. It is not uncommon to find open-source software that solves a great deal of your project requirements. This can simply be downloaded and then re-engineered very quickly.\n3.  Ethereum comes complete with its own programming language, Solidity, which runs on a blockchain. Solidity’s unique contract-oriented design simplifies blockchain development.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is generally considered to be the top go-to blockchain network on account of how big its community is and the strengths of coding Ethereum-based blockchain solutions using Solidity.\n\nPast network latency issues seem to be getting better, though, in our view, the Ethereum network pending transaction count is still too high to make it a reliably fast enough solution for most of our enterprise clients’ needs.\n\n#### Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Development Services\n\nThe Hyperledger framework is an open-source blockchain platform created and maintained by the Linux Foundation. It is a more popular solution for our enterprise company clients who are developing custom blockchain solutions. Here is why:\n\n1.  Hyperledger Fabric offers both private and permissioned blockchain technology. This means that no unknown users can act as nodes in the network. Hyperledger Fabric participants must enroll through a trusted membership service provider. Their identity is known. This makes the overall network more secure.\n2.  Hyperledger Fabric ensures data privacy via data partitions on the blockchain. Data is only allowed to be viewed by authorized users. This is another security feature that makes Hyperledger Fabric highly attractive to enterprise companies.\n3.  Hyperledger Fabric is built on a modular architecture that separates transaction processing into three phases. 1. Distributed logic processing (“chaincode”). 2. Transaction ordering. 3. Transaction validation. This separation reduces the need for required verifications across nodes and therefore offers more optimal application performance.\n\nGenerally speaking, we find that our enterprise clients choose Hyperledger Fabric due to its high degree of confidentiality, flexibility, resiliency, and scalability. You only need to compare its pending translation count to Ethereum to see why it is a much better option for businesses wanting performant applications.\n\nThat said, we have found that many of our client startups that are looking to create solutions like NFTs, etc., prefer Ethereum due to the large number of tools that it offers.\n\n#### Corda Blockchain Development Services\n\nCorda is an open-source distributed ledger platform by R3. It follows a very similar model to Hyperledger, in that it is a private blockchain that only allows users to join after they have proven that they are linked to a legal entity like an enterprise company, etc.\n\nQuite a few large organizations such as Wells Fargo and the University of Southern California have used Corda to create blockchain solutions.\n\nSome key features of Corda enterprise blockchain development are as follows:\n\n1.  Corda uses cloud-native technologies to build scalable blockchain-based applications. Developers can develop performant and reliable blockchain apps using Corda R3.\n2.  Corda supports blockchain app development for highly regulated industries. The platform is compliant with ISO 20022 and ISDA CDM.\n3.  Corda uses standard technologies, like HTTPS, REST APIs, etc., that help developers integrate Corda apps with existing systems and other third-party services.\n\n#### Python Blockchain Development Services\n\nIf you have decided to undertake Ethereum smart contract development then we will almost certainly recommend that you strongly consider using Solidity. However, our developers love to use Python for a number of key reasons:\n\n1.  It uses a simple syntax making it far easier to write good code. Good code is vital in blockchain development. Our developers recommend that our clients always use a Version control system (VCS) and rigorously test their code before launching it. Any issues relating to data written to the blockchain in error are very hard to change.\n2.  Python is versatile. Not only can Python be used to create smart contracts for NEO and Hyperledger, etc., but it can also be used to code a huge range of blockchain applications including blockchains themselves. Indeed, our developers stated that it is possible to create a very simple blockchain in around 50 lines of code.\n3.  Our developers pointed to the fact that there are lots of free blockchain development packages that are available for Python. These help them to speed up development and save you money, while they concentrate on nailing the unique features of your new blockchain project.\n\nChoosing the right framework or platform for your blockchain software project will depend on your unique development requirements.

			"article": "Types of PHP Development Services\n---------------------------------\n\nDevTeam.Space offers a comprehensive range of PHP development services, including the most popular frameworks and platforms (see below). The specific technologies that you choose for your PHP software project will depend on your unique development requirements.\n\nIf you need help, get a complimentary discovery call with one of our tech account managers by submitting your project request here.\n\n### Top 10 PHP development frameworks and platforms\n\n1.  Laravel\n2.  Symfony\n3.  Yii\n4.  CakePHP\n5.  CodeIgniter\n6.  FuelPHP\n7.  Kajona\n8.  Sansa Framework\n9.  WordPress\n10.  Drupal\n\nYou can read about the benefits of some of the top PHP development frameworks below.\n\n#### Laravel PHP Development\n\nLaravel is one of the most popular frameworks for custom PHP solutions. Laravel’s top three features are:\n\n1.  Laravel offers straightforward, effective syntax, something that makes it easy for our developers to write efficient and maintainable code. Naturally, such a clean syntax also helps to reduce coding errors.\n2.  Laravel has a great set of tools and libraries. Examples include authentication, routing, and caching, to name but a few. Again, this helps speed up development and simplifies common tasks.\n3.  Laravel contains powerful security features like protection against SQL injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and cross-site scripting (XSS). This helps developers create secure applications and reduces the time required for code reviews, testing, etc.\n\n#### Symphony PHP Development\n\nSymphony is another popular framework our clients ask our developers to use for their web application development.\n\nSymfony is a powerful PHP web application framework that is used to build performant, scalable web applications. It comes with a wide range of reusable components and tools that simplify the development process to ensure you end up with the best possible final web application.\n\nKey features and components of Symfony include:\n\n1.  The first really great feature is that Symfony is built on a collection of standalone and decoupled components that can be used independently in any PHP project. This modularity allows developers to use only the components they need, saving both time and development costs while minimizing the risk of errors.\n2.  Symfony offers flexibility in the sense of being able to choose only the desired components, libraries, and tools required for different web development requirements. Examples include routing, templating, form handling, etc.\n3.  Symfony follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This makes it easier to separate business logic, presentation, user interface concerns, etc.\n\n#### Yii\n\nYii is an open-source PHP web application framework used to develop web applications and APIs. Yii stands for “Yes, It Is!” and is known for its speed, extensibility, and developer-friendly features. Like Symphony, it also follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is another developer favorite due to its many advantages.\n\nYi’s main advantages include:\n\n1.  Yii is designed to optimize application performance. This is why our developers frequently use it when building high-traffic and resource-intensive web applications.\n2.  This powerful tool includes security features like input validation, output filtering, and protection against common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Using Yii means your application is less vulnerable to these kinds of security vulnerabilities.\n3.  Yii offers a wide range of extensions and modules that can be easily and quickly integrated into projects. These allow our developers to integrate functionality such as authentication, caching, etc., in a reliable and expedited manner.\n\nChoosing a specific framework or platform for your PHP software project will depend on your unique development requirements.

It can be used for anything from basic apps to complex blockchain or AI/ML solutions.\n\n#### PHP Software Development\n\nSince its release back in 1995, PHP has become one of the most widely used and most loved programming languages in the world today.\n\nYou will have undoubtedly used a PHP-based application within the last day or two as PHP has not only been used to build websites like Facebook and Wikipedia but was also used to build WordPress, which [according to W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress), was used to create ~40% of all websites in the world.\n\nThere are loads of reasons why developers love PHP. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  Provided you have good developers who write clean code, PHP offers a high degree of scalability without having to sacrifice performance.\n2.  It is flexible and works on most operating systems including Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.\n3.  Large community support ensures lots of cutting-edge tools, all of which help developers streamline the development process while building bigger and better applications every time.\n\n#### Ruby on Rails Software Development\n\nRuby on Rails, or Rails, is an application development framework known for its ease of use and modular design. Some of the key Rails features for software development include the following:\n\n1.  Ruby on Rails follows a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture that separates the application’s data, business logic, and user interfaces into distinct layers. The MVC pattern helps developers with the maintenance and extensibility of complex application modules.\n2.  The Rails framework is used with the Ruby programming language. Ruby is easy to understand with an English language-like syntax and a low learning curve for developers.\n3.  Ruby on Rails provides several text files, including HTML files, Ruby code files, and YAML configuration files that developers can extensively modify to code custom software modules.\n4.  Ruby on Rails offers robust database support, including SQL and NoSQL technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. Rails framework also provides a database abstraction layer that helps developers with database interactions.\n\nSo those are a few examples of the top technologies our developers use daily. Choosing a specific framework or platform for your software project will depend on your unique development requirements.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about DevTeam.Space’s software development services then you can arrange a complimentary discovery call with one of our experienced account managers by submitting your project request via the button below.",

			"article": "Types of Web Development Services\n---------------------------------\n\nDevTeam.Space offers a comprehensive range of web development services utilizing all of the most popular programming languages, frameworks, and platforms (see below). It goes without saying that which one you choose will depend on your unique web development requirements.\n\nThe great news is that our vast community of developers covers every technology stack, so no matter what your requirements, we have the experts that you need.\n\nIf you need help defining your requirements or finding expert web developers then simply request a complimentary call with one of our experienced tech account managers by submitting a request [here](https://auth.devteam.space/first-step).\n\nTo give you an idea of some of the web development technologies that we use on a daily basis, here are a few examples of the top technologies that we use to help our clients build their latest web applications.\n\n### Top 10 Web Development Technologies We Use\n\n1.  Ruby on Rails\n2.  Angular\n3.  React\n4.  Vue\n5.  ASP.NET Core\n6.  Django\n7.  Express\n8.  Laravel\n9.  Node. js\n10.  Spring\n11.  Java\n12.  Python\n13.  PHP\n14.  JavaScript\n\n#### Ruby on Rails Web Development\n\nRuby on Rails (sometimes called Rails) is one of the most popular technologies that we use in web development today.\n\nIt is an open-source web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson back in 2005.\n\nOne of the central reasons that it is so loved by developers is that Ruby on Rails is designed to simplify the process of developing web applications by providing a set of conventions and best practices. Here are a few more reasons.\n\nThe top advantages of Ruby on Rails include:\n\n1.  Rails follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which handles the presentation and user interface; and the controller, which manages user requests and interactions. The MVC pattern supports rapid, parallel development where modifications do not affect the whole model.\n2.  Rails promotes sensible defaults and conventions, reducing the need for developers to always have to think about how to structure their applications. This convention-over-configuration approach helps developers write cleaner and more maintainable code.\n3.  DRY is another great Rails feature that helps developers avoid having to write duplicate code by reusing existing code. Our developers love this.\n\nAirbnb, GitHub, and Shopify are just a few examples of the great applications that have been created using Rails.\n\nA few other very notable advantages of Rails include first-class community support, which has resulted in a huge number of Ruby on Rails applications, libraries, and snippets being made available to developers to help them quickly build in new functionality.\n\nThe other great feature is Rails’ standardized readability, a feature that makes it easy for any developer to review existing code quickly so that they can continue to build or maintain it with ease. If you are planning to use different developers to undertake the long-term maintenance of your code then this feature is very important indeed.\n\n#### Angular Web Development\n\nAngular or Angular.JS, is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It is maintained and developed by Google, which means you can expect this framework to be around for a long time yet.\n\nAngular is specifically designed to create single-page applications (SPAs). What our developers love is that it provides a powerful set of tools and features that allow them to develop performant web applications complete with a rich user interface and great functionality.\n\nThe most notable advantages of Angular include:\n\n1.  Angular applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable units of code that encapsulate both the user interface and the logic associated with it. Components can be nested to create complex user interfaces.\n2.  Angular offers two-way data binding, which means that changes in the user interface are automatically reflected in the application’s data model and vice versa. This simplifies the process of keeping the UI and data in sync.\n3.  Angular uses a dependency injection system that allows developers to easily manage and inject dependencies (such as services and data) into components, making it more modular and testable.\n\n#### React Web Development\n\nThe last web development technology that we are going to look at is React or React.js or ReactJS. Yes, just like Angular, that’s a lot of different names. We just call it React.\n\nReact is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook (Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies. React is used for developing interactive and dynamic web applications, particularly for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications.\n\nThe best features of React for web development include:\n\n1.  React is centered around the concept of components. A component is a self-contained, reusable unit of code that represents a part of the user interface. Components can be composed and nested to build complex UI structures.\n2.  React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize the rendering process. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React computes changes in a virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the real DOM only where necessary. This leads to improved performance and faster updates.\n3.  React encourages a declarative approach when building user interfaces. Developers describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state. This simplifies UI development and makes it more predictable. This leads to faster and more dependable applications.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the technologies that DevTeam.Space developers use daily to help our clients build their web development projects.\n\nKeep in mind that choosing a specific framework or platform for your web development project will depend on your specific project requirements. Nail these and you will have all the information you need to outline what professionals you will need in your development team and what skill set they will require.\n\nIf you need any help or wish to quickly access a whole community of great developers, then submit your project request via the button below and one of our dedicated account managers will be in touch to answer any questions that you might have.",

						"desc": "Front-end and back-end development are two distinct aspects of web\n development. Front-end development focuses on the user interface and\n user experience. It involves creating the visual elements of a website\n that users interact with, such as layouts, buttons, forms, and\n navigation. Front-end developers typically work with HTML, CSS, and\n JavaScript to bring the design to life.\n Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server-side part\n of the website. Back-end developers are responsible for the\n functionality of the site, including server configuration, databases,\n and application logic. They work with server-side languages like Python,\n PHP, Ruby, or Node.js to handle data storage, user authentication, and\n other core functionalities. Both front-end and back-end development are\n crucial to creating a fully functional and user-friendly website. If one\n sucks, the other most certainly will too.
