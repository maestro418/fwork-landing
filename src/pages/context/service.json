Examples include chatbot development, product recommendation systems, AI-based mobile applications, machine learning model development, etc.\n\nIn our community of over 1200 developers, we have skilled AI engineers who cover all the major AI development technologies, programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools. We have helped clients develop AI applications in every industry segment including education, healthcare, finance, commerce, and others.\n\nYou can find some examples of the technologies that our developers love to use below or alternatively, head to our case studies page to check out some of our recent AI projects.\n\nThe specific technology stack you choose for your AI application project will depend on your project requirements.\n\nIf you need help finding the right AI developers then submit your [project request here](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started/) and get a complimentary discovery call with one of our tech account managers.\n\n### Top 10 AI Development Technologies\n\n1.  Python\n2.  AWS SageMaker\n3.  Azure AI\n4.  IBM Watson\n5.  TensorFlow\n6.  Keras\n7.  Google AutoML\n8.  Theano\n9.  Caffe\n10.  Deeplearning4j\n\nHere are a few technologies that our AI engineers use on a daily basis with a brief explanation of why they love to use them.\n\n#### Python\n\nPython is one of the most popular languages for AI and ML development as well as a huge range of other software development projects that include web and mobile applications.\n\nDespite being started as a hobby project, today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages around the globe.\n\nA few fun facts our developers love are that, in Python, underscores have memory power, Python is able to define infinite numbers, and when you type “import antigravity” into Python, it gives you an easter egg!\n\nHowever, it is the following advantages that are the reason why our developers love to use Python to build powerful projects:\n\n1.  Python has a huge number of supporting libraries that aid machine learning development. Examples include PyTorch, Keras, and NLTK, all of which help simplify machine learning model development and produce performant and reliable applications.\n2.  Python is a portable language, meaning it can be used on a range of different platforms and operating systems including Linux, macOS, mobile OS, etc.\n3.  Python offers a strong level of flexibility thanks to it allowing developers to choose between different programming styles, i.e. procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.\n\n#### AWS SageMaker\n\nAWS SageMaker is another highly popular AI development tool that our developers use all the time. It is a fully managed artificial intelligence development service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world’s leading cloud services provider.\n\nThe key advantages of using AWS SageMaker for AI development are as follows:\n\n1.  Sheer size. AWS is the world’s leading cloud provider. As part of this offering, it has a huge number of tools and an almost infinite amount of processing and data storage capacity, both of which are essential for AI.\n2.  AWS SageMaker offers its AutoML jobs tool that helps automatically train advanced AI models in SageMaker pipelines. This saves an enormous amount of time and money.\n3.  Thanks to a huge development pool, AI developers have access to a large range of pre-built machine learning algorithms or models. Examples include regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc. AWS SageMaker also offers a UI-based model training tool called SageMaker JumpStart, which our developers find very handy indeed.\n\n#### Azure AI\n\nMicrosoft Azure AI is a comprehensive AI development platform that is currently regarded as one of the world’s best places to develop AI and ML software solutions.\n\nHere are some of the key features of Azure’s AI offering:\n\n1.  Like AWS, developers can build, test, deploy, and maintain AI applications using Azure, all under one roof.\n2.  Azure AI offers several low-code tools such as automated machine learning and a drag-and-drop interface. These cut down on development time and allow developers to concentrate on building and training the AI models.\n3.  Azure now offers access to a wide range of powerful AI technologies that can be painlessly integrated into your application. Examples that our developers recently used include Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI Custom Vision, Azure Databricks, and Azure AI Bot Service.\n\nIn the battle to become the go-to AI cloud development platform, AWS and Azure are doing their very best to outdo each other. This is great news for developers. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, however, it might be fairer to put it like this. Which one you ultimately decide to use depends on your specific project requirements.\n\nChoosing a specific framework or platform for your AI software project will depend on your unique application requirements.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help with your AI project, you only need to submit a project request via the button below and one of our account managers will get in touch to arrange a complimentary discovery call.",

			"article": "Types of Blockchain Development Services\n----------------------------------------\n\nFwork LLC offers a comprehensive range of blockchain development services to create, test, deploy, and maintain all kinds of blockchain-based solutions.\n\nOur expert blockchain developers have helped our clients build a range of custom blockchain solutions such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain-based supply chain apps, etc. We also regularly undertake custom smart contract development, blockchain security audits, DApp development, and more.\n\nIf you want to see some of the great blockchain projects that we have completed then take a look at our blockchain case studies page.\n\nThe blockchain technologies you choose for your blockchain project will depend on your unique development requirements.\n\nYou can either outsource your complete blockchain project to our development teams or outstaff any number of blockchain developers and manage them yourself. If you wish to learn more, get a complimentary discovery call with one of our tech account managers by submitting your [project request here](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started/).\n\n### Top Blockchain Development Technologies Our Developers Use:\n\n1.  Ethereum\n2.  Hyperledger Fabric\n3.  R3 Corda\n4.  Stellar\n5.  Solidity\n6.  Metamask\n7.  Ganache\n8.  EOS\n9.  Binance Smart Chain\n10.  Ripple\n\nOur developers use all the major technologies to create and maintain our clients’ blockchain apps. Here are a few of their favorite tools and their benefits.\n\n#### Ethereum Blockchain Development Services\n\nEthereum is the most widely used blockchain platform for creating decentralized applications. The main advantages of undertaking Ethereum blockchain development are as follows:\n\n1.  Ethereum is a mature system that allows developers to develop and deploy blockchain applications, i.e. smart contracts. Using Solidity and Vyper, developers have created everything from supply chain solutions to NFT game cards. Ethereum’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows it to run these smart contracts. If you plan to use it, you will need a developer who knows EVM requirements back to front.\n2.  Ethereum is a large ecosystem, which means there are lots of powerful development tools and solutions out there that can help with development. It is not uncommon to find open-source software that solves a great deal of your project requirements. This can simply be downloaded and then re-engineered very quickly.\n3.  Ethereum comes complete with its own programming language, Solidity, which runs on a blockchain. Solidity’s unique contract-oriented design simplifies blockchain development.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is generally considered to be the top go-to blockchain network on account of how big its community is and the strengths of coding Ethereum-based blockchain solutions using Solidity.\n\nPast network latency issues seem to be getting better, though, in our view, the Ethereum network pending transaction count is still too high to make it a reliably fast enough solution for most of our enterprise clients’ needs.\n\n#### Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Development Services\n\nThe Hyperledger framework is an open-source blockchain platform created and maintained by the Linux Foundation. It is a more popular solution for our enterprise company clients who are developing custom blockchain solutions. Here is why:\n\n1.  Hyperledger Fabric offers both private and permissioned blockchain technology. This means that no unknown users can act as nodes in the network. Hyperledger Fabric participants must enroll through a trusted membership service provider. Their identity is known. This makes the overall network more secure.\n2.  Hyperledger Fabric ensures data privacy via data partitions on the blockchain. Data is only allowed to be viewed by authorized users. This is another security feature that makes Hyperledger Fabric highly attractive to enterprise companies.\n3.  Hyperledger Fabric is built on a modular architecture that separates transaction processing into three phases. 1. Distributed logic processing (“chaincode”). 2. Transaction ordering. 3. Transaction validation. This separation reduces the need for required verifications across nodes and therefore offers more optimal application performance.\n\nGenerally speaking, we find that our enterprise clients choose Hyperledger Fabric due to its high degree of confidentiality, flexibility, resiliency, and scalability. You only need to compare its pending translation count to Ethereum to see why it is a much better option for businesses wanting performant applications.\n\nThat said, we have found that many of our client startups that are looking to create solutions like NFTs, etc., prefer Ethereum due to the large number of tools that it offers.\n\n#### Corda Blockchain Development Services\n\nCorda is an open-source distributed ledger platform by R3. It follows a very similar model to Hyperledger, in that it is a private blockchain that only allows users to join after they have proven that they are linked to a legal entity like an enterprise company, etc.\n\nQuite a few large organizations such as Wells Fargo and the University of Southern California have used Corda to create blockchain solutions.\n\nSome key features of Corda enterprise blockchain development are as follows:\n\n1.  Corda uses cloud-native technologies to build scalable blockchain-based applications. Developers can develop performant and reliable blockchain apps using Corda R3.\n2.  Corda supports blockchain app development for highly regulated industries. The platform is compliant with ISO 20022 and ISDA CDM.\n3.  Corda uses standard technologies, like HTTPS, REST APIs, etc., that help developers integrate Corda apps with existing systems and other third-party services.\n\n#### Python Blockchain Development Services\n\nIf you have decided to undertake Ethereum smart contract development then we will almost certainly recommend that you strongly consider using Solidity. However, our developers love to use Python for a number of key reasons:\n\n1.  It uses a simple syntax making it far easier to write good code. Good code is vital in blockchain development. Our developers recommend that our clients always use a Version control system (VCS) and rigorously test their code before launching it. Any issues relating to data written to the blockchain in error are very hard to change.\n2.  Python is versatile. Not only can Python be used to create smart contracts for NEO and Hyperledger, etc., but it can also be used to code a huge range of blockchain applications including blockchains themselves. Indeed, our developers stated that it is possible to create a very simple blockchain in around 50 lines of code.\n3.  Our developers pointed to the fact that there are lots of free blockchain development packages that are available for Python. These help them to speed up development and save you money, while they concentrate on nailing the unique features of your new blockchain project.\n\nChoosing the right framework or platform for your blockchain software project will depend on your unique development requirements.

			"article": "Types of Mobile App Development Services\n----------------------------------------\n\nFwork LLC offers a complete range of mobile app development services. Our developers have helped clients develop all kinds of modern native and hybrid mobile apps using all the major languages, frameworks, platforms, and other technologies.\n\nYou can either outsource your complete mobile app development project to our developers or hire a number of developers from Fwork LLC and manage them yourself.\n\nThe tech stack you choose for your mobile app development project depends on your specific project requirements.\n\nIf you need help or wish to learn more about the services we offer, get in touch for a complimentary discovery call with one of our tech account managers by submitting your [project request here](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started/).\n\n### Top Mobile App Development Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms\n\n1.  SwiftUI\n2.  Android SDK\n3.  React Native\n4.  Flutter\n5.  Java\n6.  JavaScript\n7.  Python\n8.  Ruby\n9.  AWS\n10.  Azure\n11.  AI / ML\n12.  Blockchain\n\nThe following are a few examples of the top mobile app development technologies that our developers use on a daily basis. Below, you can read about their benefits while finding out some interesting facts about them.\n\n#### SwiftUI iOS App Development\n\nSwiftUI was created by Apple to act as a powerful declarative framework to enable developers to build native user interfaces for Apple iOS. Our developers use it daily because it is the premiere programming language that is used to create Apple apps.\n\nSome of the key features of SwiftUI include:\n\n1.  Thanks to Swift’s declarative syntax, developers are now able to define the UI look and function without having to provide a sequence of procedures.\n2.  SwiftUI reliably produces a valid UI layout and is commended by our developers as being “fun to use”. This is developer speak for a big thumbs up.\n3.  It offers good support for SwiftData, which is a framework that handles data persistence, including data modeling and querying.\n\nIf you are planning to build any kind of native Apple application then you will almost certainly need to include a Swift developer in your development team.\n\n#### Android Software Development Kit (SDK) Development\n\nDeveloped by Google, Android SDK consists of a huge number of libraries and development tools that can be used to build Android applications. Again, our developers use it on a daily basis.\n\nSome great features of Android SDK include:\n\n1.  Android SDK is supported by Google, which, for any of you who has been living on another planet, also created and maintains the Android OS.\n2.  The Android SDK platform provides a multitude of great build and debugging tools. There are too many to mention but examples include Android Debug Bridge, Systrace, and Android Studio, an IDE for Android application development.\n3.  Google offers lots of API services that include Google Maps SDK, Sign-In, Pay, Fit, etc. These dramatically speed up development and help to reduce security errors and bugs.\n4.  Android SDK offers an Android Emulator. This tool allows mobile app developers to create virtual Android devices in order to comprehensively test applications for different device configurations without having to use any actual physical Android device.\n\nOur developers love Android SDK. Any chance to get help debugging code is welcomed by each and every developer on the planet. Bugs are time-consuming and often very frustrating to fix. One of our developers reminded us of a well-known developer joke, “We find the bug, we fix the bug, now we have two bugs, now we have three bugs…”\n\nDue to its huge development community that has resulted in a wide range of tools and APIs, you will need a developer very knowledgeable in Android SDK if you wish to build either a native or a hybrid Android app.\n\n#### Flutter Mobile App Development\n\nFlutter is another Google framework that enables developers to build mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps. Thanks to its growing number of advantages as it develops, more and more of our clients are starting to use Flutter for their application development.\n\nSome of the key advantages of Flutter include:\n\n1.  Flutter supports cross-platform application development from a single codebase. This means our developers can reuse these code components to build applications on multiple operating systems. This saves both time and money.\n2.  Flutter offers near-native app performance on most operating systems. This is because it piles directly to the machine code, including ARM or Intel machine code and JavaScript. The ability to generate an application that works on more than one OS, without much loss in performance, is one of the reasons that Flutter is becoming so popular.\n3.  Flutter offers an extensive widget library to create complex user interfaces. Developers can customize these widgets to meet unique design needs. Some examples include Cupertino-iOS and Material Design libraries to build UI components for iOS and Android apps.\n\n_Note: We cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting good developers who write clean code when undertaking hybrid application development, and any other development for that matter. Poorly coded hybrid apps are nothing less than a nightmare._\n\nIf you are planning to develop an application for more than one OS, then Flutter is most certainly worth considering.\n\nOur developers recommend that you get professional guidance on this because, depending on the complexity of your project, undertaking hybrid application development vs. native app development may or may not be suitable for your needs.\n\nSend us your project requirements via the button below and one of our account managers will get in touch to answer any questions that you might have.\n\n#### React Native Mobile App Development\n\nReact Native is another hybrid application development framework. It was created by Meta to help developers build mobile applications for various platforms, including iOS and Android. Some of the key React Native features include the following:\n\n1.  Like Flutter, React Native offers near-native app performance compared to other hybrid app development technologies.\n2.  React Native provides a core of platform-agnostic native components direct to the platform’s native building blocks. This saves time and increases reliability.\n3.  React Native allows developers to leverage a vast collection of pre-built UI components that developers can readily customize to meet specific UI specifications. Developers can also utilize other JavaScript libraries and tools while developing apps with React Native. This makes React Native more developer-friendly.\n\nChoosing a specific framework or platform for your mobile app project will depend on your choice of either a native or hybrid app, as well as feature specifications and other unique requirements.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can arrange a discovery call with one of our tech account managers by submitting your project request via the button below.",

If you need help understanding exactly what skills you will need, submit your [project requirements here](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started/) and get a complimentary discovery call with one of our software specialists.\n\n### Top Software Development Languages, Frameworks, and Technologies\n\n1.  Python\n2.  PHP\n3.  AI / ML\n4.  Node.js\n5.  Swift\n6.  Android Kotlin\n7.  Ruby on Rails\n8.  Express.js\n9.  .Net Core\n10.  Laravel\n11.  Express.js\n12.  Angular\n13.  React\n14.  Ruby\n15.  JavaScript\n16.  Blockchain\n17.  Cloud\n\n#### Python\n\nPython is a very popular, high-level programming language that our developers have built countless applications with. Python has a number of advantages including:\n\n1.  Python offers a straightforward and simple syntax which makes it easier to learn and use, meaning it is less likely that developers will make mistakes.\n2.  It includes built-in tools like syntax checkers, debuggers, and text editors. These are a huge bonus for any developer.\n3.  Python has a huge number (200,000 and counting) of third-party packages, libraries, and frameworks that help speed up the development process and reduce errors.\n\nDue to its versatility and its large number of support tools, Python is increasingly becoming the go-to choice for developers. It can be used for anything from basic apps to complex blockchain or AI/ML solutions.\n\n#### PHP Software Development\n\nSince its release back in 1995, PHP has become one of the most widely used and most loved programming languages in the world today.\n\nYou will have undoubtedly used a PHP-based application within the last day or two as PHP has not only been used to build websites like Facebook and Wikipedia but was also used to build WordPress, which [according to W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress), was used to create ~40% of all websites in the world.\n\nThere are loads of reasons why developers love PHP. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  Provided you have good developers who write clean code, PHP offers a high degree of scalability without having to sacrifice performance.\n2.  It is flexible and works on most operating systems including Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.\n3.  Large community support ensures lots of cutting-edge tools, all of which help developers streamline the development process while building bigger and better applications every time.\n\n#### Ruby on Rails Software Development\n\nRuby on Rails, or Rails, is an application development framework known for its ease of use and modular design. Some of the key Rails features for software development include the following:\n\n1.  Ruby on Rails follows a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture that separates the application’s data, business logic, and user interfaces into distinct layers. The MVC pattern helps developers with the maintenance and extensibility of complex application modules.\n2.  The Rails framework is used with the Ruby programming language. Ruby is easy to understand with an English language-like syntax and a low learning curve for developers.\n3.  Ruby on Rails provides several text files, including HTML files, Ruby code files, and YAML configuration files that developers can extensively modify to code custom software modules.\n4.  Ruby on Rails offers robust database support, including SQL and NoSQL technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. Rails framework also provides a database abstraction layer that helps developers with database interactions.\n\nSo those are a few examples of the top technologies our developers use daily. Choosing a specific framework or platform for your software project will depend on your unique development requirements.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about Fwork LLC’s software development services then you can arrange a complimentary discovery call with one of our experienced account managers by submitting your project request via the button below.",

			"article": "Types of Web Development Services\n---------------------------------\n\nFwork LLC offers a comprehensive range of web development services utilizing all of the most popular programming languages, frameworks, and platforms (see below). It goes without saying that which one you choose will depend on your unique web development requirements.\n\nThe great news is that our vast community of developers covers every technology stack, so no matter what your requirements, we have the experts that you need.\n\nIf you need help defining your requirements or finding expert web developers then simply request a complimentary call with one of our experienced tech account managers by submitting a request [here](https://auth.Fwork LLC/first-step).\n\nTo give you an idea of some of the web development technologies that we use on a daily basis, here are a few examples of the top technologies that we use to help our clients build their latest web applications.\n\n### Top 10 Web Development Technologies We Use\n\n1.  Ruby on Rails\n2.  Angular\n3.  React\n4.  Vue\n5.  ASP.NET Core\n6.  Django\n7.  Express\n8.  Laravel\n9.  Node. js\n10.  Spring\n11.  Java\n12.  Python\n13.  PHP\n14.  JavaScript\n\n#### Ruby on Rails Web Development\n\nRuby on Rails (sometimes called Rails) is one of the most popular technologies that we use in web development today.\n\nIt is an open-source web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson back in 2005.\n\nOne of the central reasons that it is so loved by developers is that Ruby on Rails is designed to simplify the process of developing web applications by providing a set of conventions and best practices. Here are a few more reasons.\n\nThe top advantages of Ruby on Rails include:\n\n1.  Rails follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which handles the presentation and user interface; and the controller, which manages user requests and interactions. The MVC pattern supports rapid, parallel development where modifications do not affect the whole model.\n2.  Rails promotes sensible defaults and conventions, reducing the need for developers to always have to think about how to structure their applications. This convention-over-configuration approach helps developers write cleaner and more maintainable code.\n3.  DRY is another great Rails feature that helps developers avoid having to write duplicate code by reusing existing code. Our developers love this.\n\nAirbnb, GitHub, and Shopify are just a few examples of the great applications that have been created using Rails.\n\nA few other very notable advantages of Rails include first-class community support, which has resulted in a huge number of Ruby on Rails applications, libraries, and snippets being made available to developers to help them quickly build in new functionality.\n\nThe other great feature is Rails’ standardized readability, a feature that makes it easy for any developer to review existing code quickly so that they can continue to build or maintain it with ease. If you are planning to use different developers to undertake the long-term maintenance of your code then this feature is very important indeed.\n\n#### Angular Web Development\n\nAngular or Angular.JS, is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It is maintained and developed by Google, which means you can expect this framework to be around for a long time yet.\n\nAngular is specifically designed to create single-page applications (SPAs). What our developers love is that it provides a powerful set of tools and features that allow them to develop performant web applications complete with a rich user interface and great functionality.\n\nThe most notable advantages of Angular include:\n\n1.  Angular applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable units of code that encapsulate both the user interface and the logic associated with it. Components can be nested to create complex user interfaces.\n2.  Angular offers two-way data binding, which means that changes in the user interface are automatically reflected in the application’s data model and vice versa. This simplifies the process of keeping the UI and data in sync.\n3.  Angular uses a dependency injection system that allows developers to easily manage and inject dependencies (such as services and data) into components, making it more modular and testable.\n\n#### React Web Development\n\nThe last web development technology that we are going to look at is React or React.js or ReactJS. Yes, just like Angular, that’s a lot of different names. We just call it React.\n\nReact is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook (Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies. React is used for developing interactive and dynamic web applications, particularly for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications.\n\nThe best features of React for web development include:\n\n1.  React is centered around the concept of components. A component is a self-contained, reusable unit of code that represents a part of the user interface. Components can be composed and nested to build complex UI structures.\n2.  React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize the rendering process. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React computes changes in a virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the real DOM only where necessary. This leads to improved performance and faster updates.\n3.  React encourages a declarative approach when building user interfaces. Developers describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state. This simplifies UI development and makes it more predictable. This leads to faster and more dependable applications.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the technologies that Fwork LLC developers use daily to help our clients build their web development projects.\n\nKeep in mind that choosing a specific framework or platform for your web development project will depend on your specific project requirements. Nail these and you will have all the information you need to outline what professionals you will need in your development team and what skill set they will require.\n\nIf you need any help or wish to quickly access a whole community of great developers, then submit your project request via the button below and one of our dedicated account managers will be in touch to answer any questions that you might have.",

						"desc": "Front-end and back-end development are two distinct aspects of web\n development. Front-end development focuses on the user interface and\n user experience. It involves creating the visual elements of a website\n that users interact with, such as layouts, buttons, forms, and\n navigation. Front-end developers typically work with HTML, CSS, and\n JavaScript to bring the design to life.\n Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server-side part\n of the website. Back-end developers are responsible for the\n functionality of the site, including server configuration, databases,\n and application logic. They work with server-side languages like Python,\n PHP, Ruby, or Node.js to handle data storage, user authentication, and\n other core functionalities. Both front-end and back-end development are\n crucial to creating a fully functional and user-friendly website. If one\n sucks, the other most certainly will too. Always hire great designers\n and developers."
