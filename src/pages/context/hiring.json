					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Android Developers\n--------------------------------------------\n\n![Android Developers](./5aa688b4249f12876e44b3c2ff275cd5.svg)\n\nGiven just how big the Android development segment of the global software development market is, it comes as no surprise that there are quite a few Android developers out there. However, the sheer number of Android app coders makes finding the best Android app programmers a very time-consuming task.\n\nDo you have a complex custom Android app development project? If you do then you will be looking to build a first-rate Android development team that comprises of skilled Android app developers and an experienced project manager.\n\nChances are that you are either looking for some expert Android developers to supplement your existing team or are looking to build a team of dedicated Android developers from scratch to create your Android apps. Well, the good news is that you have come to the right place.\n\nFwork LLC has been outsourcing developers to help our clients build their Android applications for over a decade now, and, in this time, we have helped them to build hundreds of great Android apps.\n\nWe have a community of more than 1200 developers and 62 development teams, all of whom we personally interviewed and vetted before allowing them to join our platform. So it is fair to say that we know a thing or two about finding that great mobile application developer.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nWe recommend that you begin by thinking through your project requirements very carefully. Only by doing this will you to understand exactly what kind of Android developer you need (i.e., do you need a full stack developer, etc.).\n\nAfter you have done this, you need to decide how you will evaluate your Android programmers. Here is a list of the general skills associated with Andoid app development. Remember that yours will be unique to your project.\n\nNative Android development skills\n---------------------------------\n\nWithout a doubt, native Android development offers the best user experience, performance, and speed to users, provided your app is coded well of course.\n\nNative Android development utilizes programming languages as well as Android technology tools such as Android Studio that are designed for the Android platform. Native apps offer the best performance and user experience.\n\nIf you decide to develop a native Android app, then you should look for the following skills in your software developer:\n\n*   Programming languages like Java or Kotlin: Java has been the mainstay for Android development for a long time. This well-established language helps you to develop secure Android apps as well as performant and scalable mobile apps. In recent years, Kotlin has emerged as a very popular choice for Android development. Kotlin helps Android programmers to achieve more by coding less, moreover, it eliminates several common coding errors by design. Our guide “[Kotlin vs Java: Which is the best choice?](/blog/kotlin-vs-java-which-is-the-best-choice/)” can help you choose the right one for your project.\n*   Native Android development tools: Developers should use Android Studio, apopular IDE for native Android development. Native Android application programmers should also know about popular testing frameworks such as Expresso.\n*   Android SDKs: As part of your project, you will likely use one or more leading 3rd party APIs. This will be to implement common features like mobile payment, etc. Leading 3rd party API providers typically offer Android and iOS SDKs. These expedite development work and help to reduce bugging errors, therefore, native Android developers should know about them.\n*   Knowledge of how to create and publish an app to the app store that adheres completely to the Google Play store guidelines.\n\nReact Native development skills\n-------------------------------\n\nIn some cases, you might need alternatives to native development. In this case, you might choose to use React Native, a popular mobile development framework. This open-source framework will help if you to develop a hybrid app that can be used on more than one OS platform.\n\nDeveloping two seperate native Android and iOS apps can be a bit expensive since you will need to hire developers with entirely different skills. Your maintenance costs will also go up too. This is why hybrid development is so appealing as it helps to lower costs (provided you have good developers who write great code that is).\n\nReact Native can be a viable alternative. While it can’t fully match the native user experience and performance, React Native does offer a near-native experience.\n\nThis application framework can access many native APIs of the Android platform. Many of its building blocks map directly to native components. Therefore, React Native delivers a much better user experience than earlier frameworks based on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\nReact Native allows a significant amount of code reuse. You can write an Android app and reuse the code for iOS app development. This keeps your mobile application development and maintenance costs down. For a mobile app developer, React Native is easy to learn too.\n\nThose are the main pros and cons, you will need to look hard at your project requirements to decide which one is most suitable for your specific needs.\n\nOther cutting-edge technology skills\n------------------------------------\n\nDepending on your business requirements, you might choose to offer certain complex features in your app. The good news is that modern technologies have made it easier to offer such features.\n\nBased on what kind of capabilities you plan to offer in your app, you might choose to implement technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Internet-of-Things (IoT), analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), etc.\n\nThe exact skill will vary based on the technology you use. For example, if you are planning to offer AI/ML-powered features, then you would need developers with Python skills. Analyze your project requirements thoroughly so you can outline the exact tech stack requirements so you can then look for the appropriate skills in your Android developer and the rest of your team.\n\nOther software development skills\n---------------------------------\n\nMobile development on the Android platform requires several other skills too. These aren’t necessarily specific to Android development, rather these are more generic skills that a software developer needs. In this category, you need to look for the following skills:\n\n### A. Application security skills\n\nYou might need to process aggregate, anonymized data like Google Analytics data in your app. Most apps process some amount of sensitive information, which might include your users’ personal information, etc.\n\nGiven growing concerns about data security, you need to proactively secure your Android app. You must comply with the stringent data security and privacy regulations applicable to your industry. Since many mobile applications now work in sync with web apps, security is vital as you will need to ensure your gateways are safe and resistant to breaches by hackers, etc.\n\nYou should look for programmers that know how to code secure apps. Developers need to follow applicable coding standards and best practices, which mitigate many key application security vulnerabilities. They also need to use modern techniques like multi-factor authentication, encryption, etc.\n\n### B. API development skills\n\nYou will likely develop 1st party APIs so that the front-end of your Android app can access the backend using a consistent framework. Using APIs can also help you to scale your development process since this can help you to iterate rapidly.\n\nREST, or “Representational State Transfer” is the de-facto standard for API development. You need programmers that know how to develop RESTful APIs. They need to use appropriate API development tools, utilize modern databases smartly, and create effective rules for API requests/responses.\n\nDevelopers need to smartly design the API endpoint URLs. Finally, they need to secure the APIs they create using techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, digital signature, quotas, throttling, etc.\n\n### C. The familiarity with cloud platforms\n\nThere is now a way that you can focus on the mobile app front-end and business logic and spend less time and resources on your mobile backend. Cloud platforms are the answer to this problem.\n\nMobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) platforms are cloud platforms that help you to build and manage your mobile backend. These platforms are fully managed by cloud providers. AWS Amplify is an example of an MBaaS platform.\n\nMBaaS platforms manage cloud infrastructure, persistent storage, etc. You can use them to easily integrate APIs, moreover, MBaaS platforms can help you to scale your app.\n\nUsing an MBaaS platform can save considerable time, which allows you to focus on the front-end. Look for developers that have familiarity with popular MBaaS platforms like AWS Amplify.\n\n### D. The experience of reviewing code\n\nYou must plan to thoroughly test your Android app, however, you need to do more. Successful project execution requires you to identify bugs early, and effective code reviews help significantly with this.\n\nOne example is application security. A number of key application security vulnerabilities are hard to find during testing, however, experienced reviewers can spot them.\n\nCode reviewers are developers too, however, they are experienced developers who have learned a lot about bugs and how to best fix them over the years. Look for developers that also know how to review code.\n\n### E. The knowledge of successfully delivering software development projects\n\nTechnical skills are important when creating any software for mobile devices, however, developers also need to know how to succeed in complex projects. The following examples illustrate this:\n\n*   While Android developers aren’t exactly UI designers, they need to know how to implement the user interface design in their code. (Keep in mind there are different Android versions where UI rules do differ slightly. Your developer needs to know about these).\n*   A software architect makes the architectural decisions, however, a programmer should know how to code in line with a specific architectural pattern.\n*   Developers need to collaborate proactively with testers and DevOps engineers. This collaboration is a crucial element in establishing an effective CI/CD environment.\n\nLook for programmers that have the skills and experience to make your project a success.\n\nHow to find the best Android developer?\n---------------------------------------\n\nBy now, you know the skills that you should look for when hiring Android app developers. You now need to take the following steps to hire such a programmer:\n\n### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire Android developers\n\nThere are numerous freelancer sites that provide access to freelance software developers. You can hire a freelance Android developer from any of these sites. Since these sites allow you to directly communicate with freelancers, you might even be able to negotiate a low rate.\n\nHowever, remember that these freelance platforms have a few big disadvantages.\n\nFirstly, they don’t provide any project management support, so you are on your own. Freelancers generally work on your project only on a part-time basis. They work on multiple projects simultaneously to increase their income.  Therefore, you will likely not get as much time and dedication from a freelancer as you will get from dedicated Android developers.\n\nOther freelancer platforms focus primarily on software development. This can be an advantage since you can get high-quality programmers. However, you don’t get any other managerial support from such platforms once you hire a developer. Finally, you will need to integrate the work of the freelancer with the rest of your team, which can be both time-consuming and problematic.\n\nTo hire full-time developers, you should contact a professional app development company that outsources its full-time developers or dev teams. A key advantage of hiring developers from a mobile app development services company like Fwork LLC is you get instant access to a vetted community of field expert developers via our streamlined hiring process that allows fast and efficient onboarding.\n\nNot only will you hire using a transparent contracting process, but Fwork LLC assigns a dedicated account manager to monitor the performance of all of our developers and we offer a replacement if the developer gets sick, etc. You account manager can even manage the development process should you require them to.\n\nYou can learn more by contacting us with your project requirements simply by clicking on one of our “Get Started” banners.\n\n### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nAssuming you have decided on which type of hiring platform to use and shortlisted the best candidates, you now need to interview them. If you are a technology expert, then you already know which questions to ask to judge their skill level.\n\nTop Tip: You must have someone skilled in Android development to ensure you can really ask the cutting questions to your candidates.\n\n**You need the right technical expertise.**\n\nYou can ask a friend or associate to interview candidates on your behalf if they have the necessary technical knowledge. Remember to cover the various kinds of skills we have highlighted. If you don’t have the skills, get in touch and we can assist you.\n\n**Gain insights about the work experience of the candidates.**\n\nAsk about the various projects they have worked on, how they achieved success, what kind of challenges they had to face, etc. When appropriate, ask the candidate to show the app they developed. Be sure to check references.\n\n**Explain your Android mobile app development requirements to the candidates in detail.**\n\nAsk them about how they would approach such a project. You should expect detailed answers and not waffle. We like to follow up the initial question with an in-depth rebuttal or enhancement on a point made in their answer to really test the candidate in full.\n\n### 3\\. Undertake a final interview to double check everything\n\nThis is standard and a no brainer. However, the key point here is that you double check everything to make sure you are 100%.\n\nTop Tip: If a candidate has struggled on any answer in the skills interview, we like to ask them it again here to see if they have found out the solution. If they have, you have a well-motivated developer on your hands.\n\nInterview tips for hiring Android developers\n--------------------------------------------\n\nConsider the following interview tips when you hire Android app developers:\n\n### A. Choose early between native Android development vs cross-platform development\n\nTo hire top Android developers, you need clarity regarding your requirements. Decide early on your Android app development approach. Choose between native development vs cross-platform development. Software engineers need vastly different skills for them. Channel your efforts efficiently.\n\n### B. Think long-term regarding your Android applications\n\nWhile you can use either Java or Kotlin for native Android development, Kotlin might just be the better long-term choice. The creators of Kotlin designed it for native development. Many expert software developers believe that Kotlin is safer than Java. Also, some languages are better than others for specific functionalities, i.e. Python for blockchain development, etc. Consider the long-term aspects when hiring Android app developers.\n\n### C. Focus on the non-functional requirements (NFRs) too\n\nUnderstandably, you need to focus on the functional requirements. Don’t cut corners concerning the NFRs though. Scalability, performance, usability, etc. are very important too. They make a sustained impact on the overall user experience.\n\nThe best Android developers know how to balance functional and non-functional requirements. Look for specialized Android developers with this knowledge.\n\nYou might find it hard to assess this skill in any freelance Android developers. Freelance Android developers might show you an impressive project portfolio. However, you can’t really gauge their true contributions to those projects.\n\nHire Android app developers from trustworthy software development companies like Fwork LLC that offer to outsource their full-time developers. Since we follow a stringent vetting process for our developers and work with them every day, we know their abilities well.\n\n### D. Prioritize the knowledge of app development processes\n\nLook for software engineers with knowledge of relevant app development processes. These include your chosen software development methodology, quality management process, software architecture, etc. Android app developers with knowledge in these areas improve the chance of your project being a success.\n\nYou might find it hard to evaluate these skills when interviewing Android development freelancers. This is another reason to hire from companies like Fwork LLC that have their own comprehensive screening process.\n\nSample interview questions to find Android developers\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAsk questions to assess the relevant Android development experience. The following are a few examples:\n\n### A. How to set up an Android device for app development and testing?\n\n**Answer**: Take the following steps:\n\nCategorize your app as “debuggable” when you register it.  \nActivate “USB Debugging” on your device.  \nFollow the Android guidelines to make configuration changes for detecting the device.\n\n### B. How do you pinpoint memory leaks in Android apps when using Android Studio?\n\n**Answer:** Use the Android Device Manager (ADM) in Android Studio. ADM helps you to pinpoint memory leaks. Launch the ADM, and you will find a heap sign. Activate it and it will help you to pinpoint memory leaks.\n\n### C. Mention some of the preliminary steps for troubleshooting an Android app that crashes often.\n\n**Answer:** Take the following preliminary steps before the specific troubleshooting work:\n\nRemove app data usage;  \nClean up the memory;  \nCheck memory usage;  \nCheck for compatibility issues.\n\nReview our [Android interview questions](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/android-interview-questions-and-answers/) for more examples.\n\nSubmit a Project With Zero Risk\n-------------------------------\n\nDeveloping an Android app can be complex. You need competent Android developers with well-rounded skills and experience.\n\nFinding competent Android developers for hire can be hard. We have explained the skills that you should look for, the various hiring platforms, and how you can best interview candidates.\n\nKeep in mind that hiring individual developers and managing their work can take a lot of time and effort. However, you can save that time if you outsource the development project to a trustworthy software development company like Fwork LLC.\n\nWe recommend that you spend a few minutes and fill out the [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form.

					"article": "How to Hire App Developers\n--------------------------\n\n![Mobile App Developers](./9ac01eeed422b298b3d9187a12278968.svg)\n\nFor companies and individuals who want to create world-class mobile applications, finding and hiring top mobile app developers from the huge global talent pool can be an enormous challenge.\n\nWhether you are a small startup company that is looking to build its first app, an entrepreneur seeking to expand into the lucrative app market, a project or product manager, a CEO, or CTO, knowing what to look for when hiring an app developer is key.\n\nUnderstanding how to sieve out the most talented developers is crucial to ensuring that your project is completed on time and to a high specification, and without it being infested with bugs.\n\nIn the spirit of Henry Ford’s statement that “working together is success”, we decided to share our expertise by putting together this informed guide on how to find and hire app developers who will help you make your dreams a reality.\n\nLet’s start with a little background about the mobile app industry.\n\nWhy Mobile Apps Are the Key to Success?\n---------------------------------------\n\nStatista estimates that the number of smartphone users will reach [7.690 billion by 2027](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218984/number-of-global-mobile-users-since-2010/).  \nAlready, the majority of the world’s population use an iPhone or Android phone in order to browse the Internet, shop in an app store or online, play games, watch videos, listen to music, etc., things that only a few decades ago seemed unimaginable to do with just one device.\n\nBut why do you need an iOS or Android mobile app, especially if you have a website is already optimized for mobile?\n\nWell, not only do you increase user satisfaction, and therefore engagement, by offering them your services via an easy-to-use app, but you also gain access to valuable user data that is not available via web applications.\n\nJust think of how much money Mark Zuckerberg has made from selling your data to third-party advertisers and you will get a clear idea of why they call data the “new gold”. Mobile apps are able to collect even more data than web apps, so they are invaluable.\n\nEven the smallest online companies can benefit from tapping into the mobile market with a simple app.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n*   Improved brand visibility and awareness. Given that Americans spend hours every day using their smartphones, it’s clear that having your mobile app on their phone will subconsciously reinforce your brand message. Every time they browse through their apps, they will see your logo, which will increase positive brand recognition if they enjoy your app experience.\n*   Creating a direct marketing channel. A mobile app can provide your customers with all the relevant information they require via push notifications, etc., including a description of your products or services, prices, promotions, FAQs, and even connect them with your customer service agents. All this will be at their fingertips via a dedicated mobile app, something which can accelerate their purchasing decisions.\n*   Providing value to your customers. You can tailor your services much more effectively via a mobile app. For example, using data harnessed by your mobile app, such as geolocation and time of day usage time, etc., you can tailor products and services according to your customers’ shopping habits. This adds value.\n*   Increasing customer engagement. A dedicated mobile app is an excellent way of boosting customer satisfaction, provided you develop a user-friendly app that allows them to easily access everything they need. This is essential for customer retention.\n\nThe mobile app market size was $106.27 billion back in 2018. Market research reports estimate that this market will reach [$407.31 billion in 2026](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200224005770/en/Global-Mobile-Application-Market-Value-to-Reach-407.31-Billion-by-2026-with-a-CAGR-of-18.4---ResearchAndMarkets.com).\n\nIt is safe to say that companies need top app developers and mobile app development services more than ever.\n\nWhat Kind of Mobile App are you Planning to Build?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore we get into mobile app developers, however, it is important to start with your project requirements. This will help us understand what kind of mobile app developers you will need.\n\nThere are literally millions of mobile apps out there. Indeed, the Apple App Store had a staggering [1.64 million apps](https://www.statista.com/statistics/779768/number-of-available-apps-in-the-apple-app-store-quarter/#:~:text=Apple%20App%20Store%3A%20number%20of%20available%20apps%20as%20of%20Q3%202022&text=During%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,in%20the%20Apple%20App%20Store.) available for download in Q3 of 2022, which, while seemingly mind-blowing, shows you just how healthy and competitive the apps market truly is.\n\nThis statistic brings us to your first decision, what platform do you intend to develop your mobile app for? There are multiple operating systems in the marketplace today, however, the market remains dominated by two main ones – Android and iOS.\n\nMost of our clients start off by either developing a native Android app or a hybrid Android/iOS app. However, some develop both a native Android and native iOS app at the same time. Whichever you choose will affect not only your project requirements but also your developer requirements.\n\nBecause mobile app development is such a vast field – just think of all the different roles those 1.64 million Apple apps have – we must limit our information to a set of general requirements for both Android and iOS mobile app developers.\n\nMuch of the information is transferrable to the other OS platforms, however, the skills we outline, as well as the example interview questions below, are limited to either Android or iOS, as indicated.\n\nIf you need further help, the simplest solution is to briefly send us your [general project requirements via this form](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) and one of our experts will get in touch to answer any questions that you might have.\n\nWhat Kind of Mobile App Developers Do You Need?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOk, so we are going to assume that you plan to develop either custom native Android/iOS apps or a hybrid Android/iOS app. We will also assume that your apps will incorporate only general functionalities and not more complex technologies such as AI, blockchain, etc.\n\nOnce again, if we miss anything, the simplest thing is just to get in touch and we can address your specific requirements in full.\n\nWith that said, let’s start.\n\n### General Mobile App Developer Skills\n\nMobile app developers require a diverse set of skills to design, develop, and maintain successful applications for smartphones and tablets. Here are some key skills that are essential for mobile app developers:\n\n*   Programming Languages: Proficiency in programming languages is crucial. For Android app development, Java and Kotlin are commonly used, while iOS app development relies on Swift and Objective-C.\n*   Cross-platform Hybrid Development: Familiarity with frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin enables developers to create apps that work on multiple platforms with a single codebase. Important if you plan to go the hybrid development route.\n*   Mobile User Interface (UI) Design (Not essential but a huge benefit): Understanding user experience (UX) principles and having an eye for mobile UI design is vital to ensure that you get a visually appealing and user-friendly end product.\n*   Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Developers should be adept at working with APIs to access and integrate various services like location-based services, payment gateways, social media platforms, etc.\n*   Database Management: Knowledge of database systems like SQLite, MySQL, or Realm is essential to ensure your app stores and retrieves app data efficiently.\n*   Version Control: Familiarity with version control systems like Git enable developers to collaborate well and efficiently manage changes in the codebase.\n*   Debugging and Testing: Proficiency in debugging tools and techniques help identify and fix bugs. Knowledge of automated testing frameworks is also valuable for efficient testing.\n*   Performance Optimization: Mobile devices have limited resources, so developers should know how to optimize app performance to ensure a smooth user experience and battery efficiency.\n*   Platform Guidelines: Understanding the specific guidelines and app store policies of the iOS and Android platforms is essential for app submission and approval. Your app must conform with the relevant guidelines.\n*   Security: Knowledge of secure coding practices and encryption techniques is crucial to safeguard user data and protect the app from potential vulnerabilities.\n*   Problem-solving: Mobile app development often involves overcoming various difficult challenges, so strong problem-solving skills are highly beneficial.\n*   Communication and Teamwork: Collaboration with designers, product managers, and other team members is common, so effective communication and teamwork skills are essential.\n*   Continuous Learning: The mobile app development landscape is constantly evolving, so developers should desire to learn new technologies and stay updated with the latest trends.\n\nAt the risk of repeating ourselves, the specific skills you will need from your developer will vary depending on the specific platform and type of app or apps that you plan to develop. However, possessing a solid foundation in these areas will undoubtedly make mobile app developers more versatile and effective in their work.\n\nA Note on Hybrid App Development\n--------------------------------\n\nWhile all custom mobile application development is complex, developing two applications using the same codebase (hybrid app development) effectively doubles the complexity in certain areas, i.e. UI implementation, etc.\n\nOur clients frequently choose React Native for their hybrid development as it is a solid and reliable tool that has a great deal of community support.\n\nNote: Your hybrid app developers must know and follow both Android and iOS guidelines when it comes to each respective app. Failure to do so will result in your app being rejected for publication.\n\nThis is a key skill requirement in hybrid mobile app developers – they must know both OS platforms that they are creating apps for inside out. You will need to tailor your interview questions to ensure you cover both. We have included a few example hybrid app development questions at the end to help you.\n\nWhile React doesn’t quite match native app performance, we describe it as “near-native”. Again, you will need to assess if your project requirements suit using React Native, i.e. a less complex, “general” app without complex technologies or functionalities, etc.\n\nIn many cases, React Native can be a viable alternative. React Native lets you reuse a significant part of your code and deploy it for both Android and iOS. This dramatically reduces the amount of time, money, and expertise you need to develop an app for both Android and iOS.\n\nHowever, and this is a big however, you must make sure that you have good developers who have the right amount of skills and experience creating similar apps to yours using React or whichever hybrid development technologies that you plan to use.\n\nWe have a surprisingly large number of clients come to us every year to ask us to rescue their failing projects on account of a single problem – bad developers.\n\nWe cannot emphasize enough the risks that come with bad developers, particularly freelance developers. Bad developers can doom all your hard work with a few bad lines of code. Don’t let it happen to you.\n\nThe simplest solution is to only hire your developers from a reputable software development company like Fwork LLC that not only fully vets each individual developer before hiring them onto the platform on a full-time basis but also assign an account manager to monitor their performance at all times.\n\nHowever, to ensure that you can explore all options, we will now move on to a few more in-depth specifics that you need from your developers before going into specific interview techniques and providing example interview questions to ensure that you get only the best developers for your project.\n\nDifferent Developer Experience Levels\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo give you a better idea of what you need, here are the different iOS developer skill levels:\n\n*   Junior iOS developers: This level starts with beginners and goes up to around 2 years of experience. Developers at this level always work under the direction of more senior colleagues. Assign them the more basic coding and testing tasks.\n*   Mid-level iOS developers: Developers at this level have 2-5 years of experience. They have worked on multiple projects already, and they can work independently. Assign them the complex coding and testing tasks.\n*   Senior iOS developers: Programmers at this level have more than 5 years of experience, and have already worked on multiple complex-level projects. Assign them any task. Since they have the skills and experience to guide their junior colleagues, they are often assigned to be team managers too. They can also make valuable contributions to various tasks, e.g., architectural decision-making, code reviews, etc.\n\nNaturally, as you go down that list, the price gets higher and higher.\n\nAdditional Skills to Look for When Hiring Mobile App Developers\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are a few obvious but very important competencies to insist on when you hire any type of mobile app developer:\n\n*   Passion for excellence;\n*   Commitment to the organizational/project objectives;\n*   Proactive attitude;\n*   Continuous learning and improvement;\n*   Teamwork;\n*   Collaboration;\n*   Communication skills.\n\nIt gets a little hard to go any deeper when we are talking about mobile app developers in a general sense. However, there is one other important hiring option that we need to cover as many of you will be considering it. That is the complete development team.\n\n### Benefits of hiring a development team\n\nMany of our clients come to us having chosen to hire a development team rather than individual developers that they manage themselves.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to this option:\n\n*   Already formed into a cohesive, well-oiled team;\n*   Comes with a project manager meaning that you don’t need to manage the team;\n*   Familiar with all the tools and channels they will use throughout the development process;\n*   No language barriers;\n*   Know each other’s strengths and weaknesses;\n*   Better accountability;\n*   Often more bandwidth.\n\nOver the last decade, it is more often the case than not that we end up finding that our clients benefit more from outsourcing a cohesive, complete development team than individual developers.\n\nNaturally, this really comes down to their specific product development requirements, however, the overwhelming benefits usually outweigh the pros of hiring individual developers.\n\nIf you are one such case, i.e., without the bandwidth to manage the project yourself or lacking in experience, etc., then it will certainly benefit you to hire a complete dev team.\n\nWe will cover how to hire a good development team in the next section. First, we will start with how to hire a great mobile app developer.\n\nHow to Hire a Mobile App Developer?\n-----------------------------------\n\nHaving covered what type of developer, and what skills you will need from them, you will now find yourself wondering how to make sure that you hire the best ones.\n\nNot to put too much focus on the obvious (but in need of mentioning), it is the interview process as well as your testing approach and reference checking that will really decide if you get the best possible developer or development team.\n\nOr will it?\n\nWell, that statement is only true if you completely ignore the option to hire from a dedicated software company that has already done the heavy lifting for you.\n\nTake, for example, Fwork LLC. We undertake a comprehensive interview and vetting process for each and every one of our developers and development teams. For those that pass, our account managers performance monitor their output at all times to ensure that our high standards of excellence are being met.\n\nAdd to this, further training to ensure that all our professionals are at the very edge of their specific technologies, and the fact that we hold all payments to our developers until you approve their work, and you can see that there is little chance at all of you getting a bad developer from a software development company with Fwork LLC’s standards.\n\nThis means that you really only need to conduct a superficial interview with your new developer or dev team when outsourcing from a reputable software development company.\n\nOk, so assuming you are hiring yourself, let’s focus in on the interview.\n\n### How a Good Interview Can Help You Find That Top Application Developer\n\n“I can write good code and always get my projects completed on time.”\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAnyone who has ever tried to hire iOS developers or Android app developers has most certainly heard a variation of this line.\n\nThe problem is that it tells you almost nothing about the individual you are interviewing.\n\nWhile hiring a remote app developer or dev team is not quite the same as taking on a new member of office-based staff, many of the same techniques can be used to recruit and test out suitable candidates. This goes for Android application developers, iOS developers, and hybrid mobile app developers too.\n\nThis means that provided you are relatively experienced at interviewing, you already have the skills that you need to find a great mobile app developer.\n\nWhen it comes to interviewing iOS or Android app developers, the main problem that most interviewers face is the gap in their own knowledge or experience.\n\nThose with little to no background in coding and mobile app development usually have a hard time trying to hire good development engineers.\n\nOne of the things that inexperienced companies learn very fast about developers is that being able to code well is not what makes a great app programmer.\n\nIn most cases, the developers who apply for the position that you are offering will almost certainly be reasonably good at writing code.\n\nA top-notch developer will obviously have no problem when it comes to coding, but will also need to have all the other necessary soft skills. In other words, your ideal candidate should be able to:\n\n*   Be highly motivated\n*   Work well with others\n*   Communicate clearly and effectively\n*   Own and learn from their mistakes\n*   Understand what contributes to a good user experience\n*   Most importantly, they should be passionate and reliable.\n\nSo, how can you find all this out in an interview to hire mobile app developers?  \nWell, the good news is that after examining the list above, you will most likely already have a few tried and tested methods or questions to establish whether or not a candidate meets each individual one.\n\nIf you don’t then we really recommend [getting in touch](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) so we can help you.\n\nWe will now share with you a few of our insider tips on how to best interview mobile developer candidates.\n\n### Interview tips to hire a mobile app developer\n\nWe have been interviewing developers and development teams for almost a decade or so. It is fair to say that we have seen and heard just about everything you could imagine (oh yes, we have even had candidates trying to sneakily find answers via ChatGPT while in the interview, etc.).\n\nTo date, we have interviewed thousands of developers and dev teams and have learned all the tricks of the trade when it comes to nailing the best from the rest, which is why we can proudly say that our developer community consists of only the very best professionals in the industry.\n\nWhile we cannot reveal too many insider secrets (we are after all, in a very competitive business), we can give a few tips on how to ensure you get only the best developers or development teams for your project.\n\nUnlike every other post on this topic, we will assume that you know how to undertake a general interview. Yes, you got it, arrange a screening interview, ask relevant questions, check their resume and past projects, arrange a second skills interview, give a coding test, and then undertake a final interview.\n\nNow that’s covered, let’s start.\n\n*   AVOID FREELANCERS – We cannot emphasize more strongly the need to avoid hiring freelancers. Individuals who work on your project on a part-time basis cannot give your project the due care and diligence it deserves. Some of the shocking examples of poor behavior by freelancers that we have to pick up the pieces from have done nothing less than bring shame on our profession. Why take the risk? Hire developers from a dedicated software development company. The price for failure is just too high.\n*   Be prepared – We cannot emphasize enough the advantages of preparation. You should know your project requirements back to front and understand exactly what you need from your developer. You should have planned your interview carefully and, as mentioned above, have either the expertise yourself, or have someone with you who can truly put the candidate on the hot plate to make sure they know their stuff.\n*   In the screening interview, we like to throw in a seemingly random question that allows the candidates to quickly deal with a change of direction that tests their logical abilities. A classic example is the ‘Where am I standing in the world’ question used by Elon Musk.\n*   During the skills assessment interview, you must have someone on hand who is more senior in experience than the candidate. This is a top tip that has really allowed us to immediately double down on our candidates’ answers by getting them to solve a further problem, etc. We have caught out a huge number of candidates this way.\n*   From time to time during the coding assessment we have inserted a few lines of poorly written or functioning code into the candidate’s code. We then explained the resulting problem being caused by this code and asked the candidate to explain what is going on? It is a great indicator to see how quickly the candidate spots the problem and how sternly they defend their position, up to and including the words “this is not my code”.\n*   Don’t wait until the final interview to quiz the candidate on how they work around time zone issues, religious holidays, etc. This is very important as all such issues need to fit into your project. Interviewing a great developer and then finding out at the last minute that they won’t have more than an hour a day to communicate with your team is a total waste of time.\n*   Finally, make sure that you standardize your interview questions and record your interview so that you can compare candidates effectively.\n\n**Top Tip 1:** We really value honesty in our candidates. When you are dealing with remote employees, one of the central pillars is that they are honest.\n\nDon’t over-penalize a developer because they couldn’t find an immediate solution to a problem during the interview. The way that you effectively test this is (assuming they impress you sufficiently in all other areas) to let them pass into the next round of interviews and then ask them the problem once again.\n\nIn our experience, any great developer worth their salt (regardless of experience level) will have wanted to find the answer to that problem and will have done so after the interview. If they have not, then probably you will be better off giving them a miss to be totally honest.\n\n**Top Tip 2:** We prize motivation above anything. With high levels of motivation, you get someone who not only guarantees high levels of productivity and dedication but also someone who will go the extra mile to ensure your project is a success.\n\nTo put it bluntly, you can find lots of unmotivated, but talented developers, but you don’t find a single unmotivated great developer.\n\n**Top Tip 3:** Ensure that you have at least a 4-hour time zone overlap either in the morning or afternoon. Ideally, you want time at both the start or the end of the day, if not all day, where possible.\n\nTime zone issues can be very frustrating, particularly at times during the development lifecycle where you need a lot of back-and-forth communication. Examples include project sprint planning, dealing with roadblocks, etc.\n\nSave yourself the nightmare and plan for this upfront. This issue is one of the biggest affecting remote work and is why Fwork LLC has tailored its developer community to ensure that we have developers all over the world.\n\nAdded to this, we assign a dedicated account manager to all our developers and development teams to ensure that you get quick and reliable communication at all times.\n\nHow to Hire a Development Team?\n-------------------------------\n\nHiring a complete development team can seem like it is more challenging as most project owners or managers feel they have more control when they hire individually.\n\nHowever, as we mentioned a little while ago, there are a number of very important advantages to hiring a complete development team rather than trying to put one together yourself. We have covered these so won’t repeat them here.\n\nThe real trick here is simply to view it as a group of individuals that you not only can interview one by one but also have the luxury of being able to interview all together to see how well they work as a group.\n\nWe love development team interviews for this very reason. You can undertake the exact same interview approach as you do with individual developers.\n\nStart with a screening interview with the whole team before undertaking individual skills interviews (this will include a specific interview for the project manager too) before assigning the whole team a test coding exercise. You will then finish up with a final interview if fully satisfied.\n\nIf you have any doubts, for example, about an individual developer, then get them back in for an additional interview or test. Don’t accept the whole team until you are 100% with each individual. Trust us on this, we have interviewed hundreds of development teams over the last decade and never accept one unless we are 100%. This is exactly how you get the best development teams.\n\nAnother important thing that you can learn from a lengthy interview process is just how motivated the team really is. If you see any kind of drop-off in work quality, communication, etc., you will have an indication that perhaps the team is not as committed to your project as you might want.\n\nThe only drawback to this process is that it takes a long time. Happily, you can bypass this lengthy chore almost entirely by hiring directly from a dedicated software development company like Fwork LLC.\n\nWe’ve already done this all for you.\n\nOk, so assuming you are still pressing ahead with hiring your developers or development team independently, then here are some handy interview questions to help you nail that great developer.\n\nAsk questions to test the hands-on skills of mobile app developers. You can refer to the following list of interview questions offered by us:\n\n*   [Android interview questions;](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/android-interview-questions-and-answers/)\n*   [iOS interview questions;](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/ios-interview-questions-and-answers/)\n*   [Swift interview questions;](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/swift-interview-questions-and-answers/)\n*   [Java interview questions.](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/java-interview-questions-and-answers/)\n\nHere are some quick reference sample questions:\n\nAndroid Interview Questions Examples:\n-------------------------------------\n\n### A. Explain the differences between vectors and arrays in Java.\n\n**Answer:** Vectors in Java are dynamically allocated. They have dynamic lists of references to other objects. Vectors can hold data from different data types, and their size can change as needed. Arrays are static. They have a fixed size and fixed primitive type.\n\n### B. When should you test an Android app on a real device and not on an emulator?\n\n**Answer:** You shouldn’t test an Android app on an emulator in the case of interrupted scenarios.\n\nThese are as follows:\n\n*   Insertion and removal of memory cards;\n*   Incoming calls when the app is active;\n*   An incoming SMS when the application is active;\n*   Bluetooth connection;\n*   Low-battery notification.\n\n### C. What are some of the preliminary steps to troubleshoot an Android app that frequently crashes?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n*   Check memory usage;\n*   Clean up the memory;\n*   Remove app data usage;\n*   Check for compatibility issues.\n\nReview our [Android interview questions](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/android-interview-questions-and-answers/#:~:text=Example%20Junior%2Dlevel%20Android%20Developer,and%20running%20of%20mobile%20applications.) for more examples.\n\niOS Interview Questions Examples:\n---------------------------------\n\n### A. How will you define a “base class” in Swift?\n\n**Answer:** Swift has “superclasses”. Other classes can inherit methods, properties, and functions from a superclass. You can define a “base class” by not defining its superclass.\n\n### B. Which API should you use to write test scripts to evaluate an iOS app’s UI?\n\n**Answer:** Developers can use the UI Automation API for this. They will prepare JavaScript test scripts and use the UI Automation API to simulate user interactions with the application.\n\n### C. Explain the differences between non-atomic and atomic properties.\n\n**Answer:** An atomic property will always produce a fully initialized object. iOS developers often consider it risky to retrieve an uninitialized value of a property. In some situations, it might not be risky if they can configure the property as non-atomic. iOS developers do this to achieve better performance.\n\nReview our iOS interview questions if you need more examples.\n\nHybrid App Interview Questions (Using React Native) Examples:\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### A. How does React Native facilitate cross-platform development?\n\n**Answer:**\n\nReact Native allows for cross-platform compatibility by utilizing a bridge that translates JavaScript code into native components and modules. These then allow for interaction with each specific platform’s APIs.\n\n### B. Explain the meaning of “props” and “state” in React Native and detail when you would use them and how they contribute to building reusable components.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nIn React Native, “props” stands for properties, and “states” are fundamental concepts that are used to manage and pass data between various components.\n\nProps work by passing from the “parent” to “child” components. As well as static data, they are also able to pass configurations, however, they are designated as read-only within the child component.\n\nStates are mutable objects within components that hold dynamic data that can change over time. States are used to manage a component’s internal state and render UI elements based on specific changes.\n\nIt is essential to use props when building reusable components to create inputs that are constant across instances of the component and use states for managing unique and dynamic behavior within a specific instance.\n\n### C: How would you optimize the performance of a React Native application, especially when dealing with a large and complex UI? Mention some techniques and tools you would use.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nOptimizing the performance of a React Native application is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. Some techniques and tools include:\n\n*   Component Lifecycle Methods: Properly using lifecycle methods like shouldComponentUpdate and componentDidUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of components and to handle updates efficiently.\n*   Virtualization: Leveraging FlatList and SectionList components to efficiently render large lists of data by rendering only the visible items on the screen, which reduces memory and processing overhead.\n*   Memoization: Using the React.memo higher-order component to memorize and cache the rendering of functional components, preventing redundant renders when props have not changed.\n*   Performance Profiling: Utilizing tools like the React DevTools and React Native Debugger to analyze component renders, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize the rendering process.\n*   Code Splitting: Employing code splitting techniques to load only the necessary code and assets for the current screen, reducing the initial loading time.\n*   Minimizing UI Thread Blocking: Offloading heavy computations and operations to worker threads or native modules to avoid blocking the UI thread and maintain a responsive UI.\n*   Bundling and Compression: Using bundling tools like Metro to bundle and compress the JavaScript code and assets, reducing the overall app size and improving loading times.\n\nThese strategies, along with continuous testing and profiling, can help ensure that the React Native app performs well under various conditions and on different devices.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nLooking to hire an app developer for your app development team?\n\nYou should now have a much better idea about what makes a good mobile app developer. Remember that you should arm yourself with a good understanding of your product specification as this is key to finding the best developer for your needs.\n\nWhen hiring app developers from an outsourcing company, try to avoid freelance app developers, instead, hire software developers who work full-time for the software development companies you hire from.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our community of vetted expert app developers then simply fill out a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form.

					"article": "How to Hire iOS Developers\n--------------------------\n\n![iOS Developers](./edd3546630e8eba9b69184acec576dbd.svg)\n\nAre you planning to target iPhone and iPad users by hiring iOS developers and building a new app? If you are then you have made a smart decision since Apple has a very large and loyal customer base.\n\nIn our guide “[How to Convert a Website into an iOS App](/blog/how-to-convert-your-website-into-an-ios-app/)”, we touched on why iOS apps are so lucrative. In brief, just consider that the Apple App Store had 1.64 million apps as of Q3 2022, which combined, generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, and you can see why so many companies want to develop Apple apps.\n\nHow can you make a splash in the lucrative iOS market?\n\nWell, you need to design and develop your app in such a way that enables you to offer a truly unique experience to users. It won’t cut it if your app is yet another generic one floating in a large pool of similar apps. It will sink.\n\nWhat do you need to design and develop an app that stands out? Well, you will need:\n\n*   Excellent project management\n*   Effective development architecture\n*   Clear requirements\n*   An effective development approach\n\nThis list is missing one very important thing – developers.\n\nYou 100% need great iOS developers in your team to ensure your project’s success.\n\nHow do you find such developers? Well, this guide on how to hire iOS developers will explain exactly that.\n\n### What Kind of iOS Developers Do You Need?\n\nAn iOS development project involves several key tasks, e.g., requirements definition, architectural decision-making, formulating a development approach, development, review, testing, deployment, etc.\n\nNaturally, you will need iOS developers to help with most of these tasks, so you need developers with a good level of experience.\n\nTake, for example, the task of formulating an effective development approach. While you will need your project manager (PM) and infrastructure architect to play key roles in this, you also need iOS developers to offer valuable input.  So their experience counts.\n\nFor more information on this read our article “[What is the best development approach to guarantee the success of your app](/blog/what-is-the-best-development-approach-to-guarantee-the-success-of-your-app/)?”. It covers in more detail why you need people with plenty of experience to define your project’s development approach.\n\nCompare this with the task of coding. You need iOS developers who can follow the technical design and code the app, therefore, they don’t need to have an exceptionally high level of experience, though let us be clear, experience counts when it comes to coding too.\n\nTo give you a better idea of what you need, here are the different iOS developer skill levels:\n\n*   **Junior iOS developers:** This level starts with beginners and goes up to around 2 years of experience. Developers at this level always work under the direction of more senior colleagues.\n*   **Mid-level iOS developers:** Developers at this level have 2-5 years of experience. They have worked on multiple projects already, and they can work independently.\n*   **Senior iOS developers:** Programmers at this level have more than 5 years of experience, and have already worked on multiple complex-level projects. They have the skills and experience to guide their junior colleagues. They make valuable contributions to various tasks, e.g., architectural decision-making, code reviews, etc.\n\n### Roles and Responsibilities: Key Considerations When Hiring iOS Developers\n\nNow that you know the various levels of experience, let’s see how you can utilize them optimally.\n\nYou will need to plan the roles and responsibilities of each developer. This will help you to utilize them effectively, however, it does much more than that.\n\nThink for a moment from the perspective of your programmers. They need clarity on what each of them needs to do. Define their roles and responsibilities early on to offer them this clarity.\n\nYou can do this by distributing responsibilities according to their seniority levels, e.g.:\n\n*   **Junior iOS coders:** Assign them the more basic coding and testing tasks.\n*   **Mid-level iOS programmers:** You need them to code and test, however, you will also need more from them. Mid-level developers will regularly coordinate with the testing and DevOps teams, which will help you execute the project smoothly.\n*   **Senior iOS software engineers:** Ideally, you shouldn’t assign a significant amount of basic coding and testing tasks to them. Instead, you should ask them to provide inputs to architectural decision-making, UI design, test planning, test case preparation, code review, and quality control activities.\n\nSee how iOS development is much more than just coding? You need a well-rounded team for this, and this is where we at Fwork LLC can help. Our iOS development services, which include allowing companies to outsource our developers, offer all the technical skills and expertise your project will need. However, we also offer a lot more.\n\nWith our deep knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, and processes-methods-and-tools (PM&T), we can carry out all the above-mentioned responsibilities. With us, you don’t just get programmers, rather, you get fully-vetted, field-expert software developers and development teams with years of experience creating performant and maintainable iOS software solutions.\n\n### Choose Between Native vs Hybrid Development Before Hiring iOS Developers\n\nWe will start with the first choice that you need to make. Are you planning to build a native iOS app or a hybrid app?\n\nNative apps deliver a better user experience. These apps offer better security and performance, too. However, you require a bigger budget for native app development.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrid apps have one codebase and can run on both Android and iOS. While they fall short when it comes to offering a native-level user experience, you incur lower development costs and you can launch your app faster.\n\n### What Skills Should Top iOS Developers Have for Native Development?\n\nPlanning to develop a native iOS app? You need to use either Swift or Objective-C since these are the Apple programming languages used for developing native iOS apps.\n\nSwift is a modern language that is used for native iOS development. This popular language offers many advantages, e.g.:\n\n*   Its advanced operators reduce the coding effort.\n*   You can code fast and performant iOS apps using Swift since it’s a lightweight language.\n*   Swift eliminates several common coding errors, thanks to its advanced features.\n*   Programs written in Swift are highly readable, which improves its maintainability as well.\n*   Since Apple prefers Swift for iOS apps, you get better “App Store Optimization” (ASO).\n\nWhere does this leave Objective-C? Well, if you think Objective-C doesn’t appeal to native iOS developers anymore, then you might be surprised. While Swift is a modern language and highly popular, Objective-C still has a wide following.\n\nObjective-C offers many advantages, e.g.:\n\n*   Objective-C evolved from C, the highly successful programming language. It has powerful extensions that make for excellent object-oriented programming.\n*   Apple uses Cocoa programming heavily in its frameworks, and Objective-C is the mainstay of Cocoa programming.\n*   Many native iOS developers know Objective-C well, which is always a great advantage when you undertake a native iOS development project.\n\n### Other iOS Development Skills You Should Look For\n\nYou should now know which programming language skills to look for when hiring iOS developers. However, you need to look for a few more iOS development skills, e.g.:\n\n*   You need programmers who are familiar with Xcode, the popular IDE.\n*   Top iOS developers should be familiar with APIs like Cocoa Touch, UIKit, etc.\n*   You need iOS developers with good knowledge of the “Core Data framework”.\n\nWhat about your UI design? Will you need developers with expertise in UI/UX design?\n\nIn most cases, the answer is a definitive yes. Since most user interaction revolves around the UI, having a great UI is a must in today’s world.\n\nYou will want to onboard experienced UI designers. This will mean that you don’t need your iOS developers to double up as UI design experts.\n\nWhen you are hiring iPhone app developers, ensure that they understand the following:\n\n*   Apple’s “Human Interface Guidelines”;\n*   How to code effectively to take advantage of your choice of mobile navigation menu pattern.\n\nSenior iOS developers in your team should have the capability to contribute valuable ideas towards your UI design. E.g., they should take part in wireframing screens, moreover, they need to offer valuable input to the UI designers.\n\n### Hybrid iOS Development: What Skills Do You Need?\n\nAre you planning on developing a hybrid app? You will need to use popular hybrid development frameworks like React Native or Xamarin if you are. Take the case of React Native, for example, let’s see what advantages it offers.\n\nYou can reap many benefits from using React Native for iOS development, e.g.:\n\n*   React Native uses JavaScript, and you can find JavaScript developers relatively easily.\n*   This popular framework features “Hot Reloading”, which makes development more efficient.\n*   React Native allows for smooth UI interactions, therefore, you can offer a user experience that’s as close to native as it gets.\n*   If you already have a web app, then you can easily launch a hybrid iOS app with the help of React Native with the added bonus of keeping your development costs down.\n\n### Hiring iOS App Developers? Look for Knowledge of Architecture\n\nWe will now describe the generic software development skills and competencies that you should look for when hiring iOS developers.\n\nLet’s start with architecture.\n\nIt is unlikely that you will be planning to [hire an iOS developer](/hire-ios-developers/) who will also work as the project’s architect. You will make these software architectural decisions long before the job of coding starts, therefore, the architect’s role is a distinct one.\n\nHowever, you will need to hire iOS developers who can code in line with your choice of architectural pattern. Ideally, you also need senior part-time or full-time iOS developers who can point out any sub-optimal architectural decisions, etc.\n\nWhen you correct your architectural decisions based on such feedback, you will introduce some degree of rework. However, this will deliver better results in the longer term, e.g., scalability, performance, etc., so it is worth the backtracking required.\n\nFwork LLC’s iOS development teams aren’t only experts in application development, but we also have senior developers with in-depth knowledge of all the different software architectural patterns used today. Read “[10 best practices for building a Microservice architecture](/blog/10-best-practices-for-building-a-microservice-architecture/)” for more on this.\n\n### iOS Developers for Hire Need Knowledge of Application Security\n\nYou will be planning to ensure that your iOS app is secure from cyber-attacks. In order to do this, you will have to seek advice from software security experts and will then ask your architect to create a strategy around your findings.\n\nOnce again, if you hire iOS developers, it is unlikely that you will ask them to work as your information security experts. However, developers need knowledge of application security, and this is one of those generic skills we expect from all programmers.\n\nWhy should you hire iOS developers with application security knowledge? The answer to this question lies in how you mitigate mobile application security vulnerabilities.\n\nYou need to take two parallel streams of action.\n\nThe first stream involves infrastructure, tools, etc. This includes using the right kind of cloud computing infrastructure, employing techniques like encryption and digital signature, the use of real-time threat intelligence tools, using next-generation firewalls, etc.\n\nThe other stream of action concerns how you code your application. The “[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)” (OWASP) team has researched application security and has identified the top 10 application security risks.\n\nYou need to follow the right coding guidelines and best practices to mitigate many of these risks, e.g., injection, XML external entities (XXE), insecure deserialization, etc.\n\nNaturally, you need developers who know how to prevent such vulnerabilities.\n\n### Look for API Development Experience When you Hire an iOS Developer\n\nYou are likely planning to develop APIs to implement your core features. APIs enable you to scale your development process since they provide a consistent framework for your application front-end to access the backend.\n\nNaturally, you will need iOS developers with experience in developing APIs. API development is another one of the generic development skills we require in our iOS developers that we mentioned earlier.\n\nREST (Representational State Transfer) is the de facto standard for API development. Most projects will involve you developing RESTful APIs. In order to develop such APIs, programmers need in-depth knowledge of the following:\n\n*   API development tools like Postman;\n*   API documentation tools like Swagger;\n*   Modern databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.\n*   Securing APIs using techniques like encryption, digital signatures, quotas, throttling, etc.;\n*   Designing meaningful URLs for the APIs;\n*   Formulating effective rules for API requests and responses.\n\n### Top iOS Developers Need to Know How to Scale a Mobile App\n\nYou don’t need us to tell you just how important the scalability of your iOS app is. As you grow your business and attract new users, scalability will become a key factor that will influence your ongoing success. Naturally, you should onboard iOS developers who know how to code a scalable mobile app.\n\nVarious factors play their part in determining whether an app will scale well, e.g., the architectural pattern you use, your choice of cloud platform, the databases you use, etc. Your iOS architect will make a lot of these decisions.\n\nHowever, architectural decisions can go wrong, and often do. This is where the input from your senior iOS developers can make a big difference.\n\nTake, for example, the case of building and managing the mobile backend.\n\nIt takes considerable time to build and manage the mobile backend. If you aren’t using a “Mobile Backend as a Service” (MBaaS) platform, then you should consider using one.\n\nMBaaS platforms manage the cloud infrastructure and persistent storage, therefore, you don’t need to spend a lot of time building the mobile backend.\n\nOn top of that, MBaaS platforms help companies to scale their mobile apps. If you have knowledgeable iOS developers on your team, then they can show you the value of using an MBaaS platform.\n\nIf you don’t have these then you really should enlist the help of an experienced app development company such as Fwork LLC.\n\n### Look for Code Review Experience When Hiring iOS Developers\n\nYou need a robust “Verification & validation” process to achieve success in your iOS app development project. “Validation” refers to testing. You must implement a comprehensive testing process in your team.\n\nHowever, you will want to find defects even before you start testing. The earlier you find bugs, the less expensive it is to fix them. How do you find bugs early? This is where “verification” plays a part. This means a systematic and structured review.\n\nVerification includes the review of requirements, design, test plan, test cases, and code. You need senior developers who can review the code of your junior and mid-level developers, therefore, look for this expertise when you hire iOS developers.\n\nCode reviewers do the following:\n\n*   Run automated code review tools to detect those “low-hanging fruits”;\n*   Review the code to determine if it will deliver the intended functionalities;\n*   Verify whether the code follows the applicable standards and guidelines;\n*   Check whether the code will meet the “Non-Functional Requirements” (NFRs) like scalability, availability, etc.;\n*   Unearth application security vulnerabilities in the code.\n\nCode reviewers need in-depth technical skills, moreover, they should have many years of experience working as developers. They need excellent knowledge of software defect prevention methods and practices, furthermore, they ought to have adequate “people skills” to foster collaboration with developers.\n\nIt sounds like a hard-to-find combination, don’t you think? At Fwork LLC, we have used our extensive industry experience to solve this issue. Our senior developers have considerable experience in code review, as well as working with our programmers as we employ them all on a full-time basis. We solved this problem so our clients don’t have to.\n\nFor more on this, you can read our article “[Why choosing Fwork LLC to review your code can ensure your software product is a success](/blog/choose-devteam-space-to-review-your-software-product-code/)”.\n\n### How to Hire an iOS Developer?\n\nWe have detailed what skills you will likely require in your iOS developers. Remember that your requirements will be project specific, so they will differ slightly. You may find yourself now asking the following questions:\n\n*   “Where can I find iOS app developers?”;\n*   “How much does it cost to hire an iOS developer?”\n\nTake a step back and ask a more fundamental question, namely, “Do I really want my iOS app development project to thrive and not just succeed?”. No points for guessing that your answer is a resounding, “yes”.\n\nWell, then you need much more than individual iOS developers. Let’s examine why.\n\nWe have already talked about development, architecture, application security, code review, etc. However, you need a functional DevOps process to succeed with any project.\n\nYour team will not only consist of talented iOS mobile developers, but it will also need testers, DevOps engineers, etc. You need an effective CI/CD environment to succeed, and this requires excellent collaboration between developers, testers, DevOps engineers, the “Scrum Master”, etc.\n\nYou can find iOS developers on various freelance platforms, however, those platforms will not offer you a cohesive team that fosters collaboration.\n\nA field expert development team is essential, and as such, Fwork LLC is just the right partner for you. Read “[Freelance app development team vs. field expert software development teams](/blog/freelance-app-development-team-vs-field-expert-software-development-teams/)” to find out how our teams value collaboration as a primary ingredient of success.\n\n### Interview tips for you when you hire iOS app developers\n\nConsider the following interview tips:\n\n#### A. Choose between Swift and Objective-C early\n\nWhile you can use either Swift or Objective-C for native iOS mobile app development, you should make a choice early. You can then concentrate your efforts on hiring developers with the appropriate language skills.\n\nConsider this thumb rule: Hire iPhone app developers with Swift skills if you are developing a new app. You should hire Objective-C developers only if you need to maintain an Objective-C app. All new iOS app development projects can use Swift.\n\n#### B. Remember that you need to regularly add new features\n\nYou will often enhance a mobile app by adding new features. Therefore, you need developers that have documented the code well. Enhancing a well-documented code is easier. Look for this experience.\n\nThis can be hard to assess when you hire freelance iOS developers. Freelance iOS developers might make tall claims about their experience. However, you could find it hard to verify these claims.\n\nThis problem is compounded if you hire remote iOS developers. You don’t meet remote iOS developers face-to-face. You could find it hard to assess the real expertise and experience of remote iOS developers.\n\nThis is why we recommend you hire developers from trusted software development companies like Fwork LLC. Companies like Fwork LLC do the hard work of screening developers upfront. All of our developers work for our platform on a full-time basis and our account managers ensure their work meets our high standards at all times.\n\n#### C. Look for the knowledge of the key libraries\n\nYou want developers who know how to utilize the support for dynamic libraries in Swift. They should know the libraries well. Your team can then gain from a significant rise in productivity.\n\nExamples of interview questions when you hire iPhone app developers\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAsk questions to assess the hands-on knowledge of developers. The following are a few examples:\n\n#### A. Which API should you use for writing test scripts to evaluate the UI elements of an iOS app?\n\n**Answer:** iOS development project teams can use the UI Automation API for this. They can prepare JavaScript test scripts. Testers can use the UI Automation API with them. This simulates user interactions with the application.\n\n#### B. Explain the differences between non-atomic and atomic properties in iOS development.\n\n**Answer:** An atomic property will always produce a fully initialized object. iOS developers often consider it risky to retrieve an uninitialized value of a property. In some situations, they might not consider it risky. They can configure the property as a non-atomic one in that case. iOS developers might sometimes want to do this for better performance.\n\n#### C. Explain the differences between the keywords “retain” and “assign”?\n\n**Answer:** You use the keyword “retain” to exercise control over one object. This keyword associates a particular function with an object. On the other hand, the “Assign” keyword provides an attribute to an object. This helps to qualify the object. The object will now have its own definition.\n\nReview our [iOS interview questions](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/ios-interview-questions-and-answers/) for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\niOS application development is a lucrative business when companies get it right.\n\nA popular iOS application can find itself with hundreds of thousands of users in a very short space of time. Apple mobile users outspend their Android rivals by a considerable amount when it comes to in-app purchases too.\n\nDespite the popularity of iOS, finding great iOS developers for hire can be challenging. The challenge is made even more difficult if you only have limited experience in the field.\n\nIt is for that reason you should only hire the best iOS developers. You can start your search by submitting a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form so you can find out about our vetted community of field expert iOS developers.\n\nAfter you submit it, one of our dedicated account managers will arrange a call to answer any questions you might have."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Swift Developers\n------------------------------------------\n\n![Swift Developers](./6a6a5b1d37ae25f7846832ba06ee42e6.svg)\n\nSwift is an open-source programming language that was developed by Apple for use on its iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms. If you are looking to build a software product for any Apple operating system then it is likely that you will need to hire Swift Developers.\n\nSwift was first released back in 2014 and was designed to reduce the number of programming errors as well as incorporate a number of developer-freindly features including “protocol-oriented programming”.\n\nThanks to it being supported by Apple for iOS app development, The Swift language has become a language that many software developers have experience coding in. Apple has helped Swift app development by publishing transparent and comprehensive guidelines that software must adhere to in order to be released on the Apple app store.\n\nSince there are many developers who code full-time using Swift, you won’t find it very difficult to find one. The real challenge is to find a talented Swift developer who will build you a first-class application.\n\nThere are a number of different hiring models available to those looking to hire Swift developers. These include general-purpose freelancer sites, software development-specific freelancer sites, and dedicated software development companies that offer developer outsourcing.\n\nBefore we examine the strengths and weaknesses of each of these hiring models, let’s start by outlining the main skills that you will need from your Swift developer.\n\n### Essential Swift development skills\n\nYou will need to look for the following Swift skills:\n\n*   A good grasp of Swift syntax\n*   Optionals\n*   Control flow\n*   Classes, inheritance & initialization\n*   Objective-C interoperability\n*   Error handling\n*   JavaScript object notation\n*   (GCD) Grand Central Dispatch.\n\n### Other skills that a Swift application developer needs\n\nSwift developers also need several more core skills which are as follows:\n\n#### A. Apple Design Guidelines\n\nComprehensive knowledge of Apple development guidelines is essential if you want to ensure that you can publish your finished software product. Apple’s website has all the necessary documentation, your developer must know it back to front.\n\nAny software applications that are found in violation of the rules will be rejected immediately.\n\nSince Apple has created these guidelines to ensure apps run quickly and properly, as well as reduce the chances of security issues or Swift coding errors, you need to make sure your Swift developer is working within them.\n\n#### B. The knowledge of Swift iOS and Android development\n\nNative apps built for the iOS operating system utilize device-specific features of the iPhone, iPad, and iWatch mobile devices.\n\nYou need to find a Swift programmer who is able to get the best performance out of your mobile application. This will mean that they must have experience in using such things as plugins in order to effectively add additional features and functionalities to your iOS app that always look and act great.\n\nAny experienced iOS developer will know the development process back to front and will also know the main pitfalls and how to avoid them. This will help them maximize the user experience, which will ultimately lead to good customer satisfaction levels.\n\n#### C. Familiarity with cloud platforms\n\nCloud platforms are one of the most powerful tools in the developer’s arsenal. “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) or “Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service” (MBaaS) platforms can save lots of time and money as they handle the infrastructure so you only need to focus on the development. These platforms also allow software owners to scale their products easily and cost-effectively.\n\nYou will likely want Swift programmers that have worked on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, etc., as these are the most popular solutions out there.\n\n#### E. The knowledge of application security\n\nNo matter whether you are building a cross-platform app or a native app, security is one of the most important parts of your product. You will need coders who have a good level of experience in application security.\n\nOnly hire Swift developers who understand how to quickly identify application security vulnerabilities and fix them. Ideally, they should have good technical skills in debugging both their and other Swift programmers’ code.\n\n#### G. Track record in delivering high-quality app development services\n\nWhile it is true that Swift application developers learn most from their failures, they still need to have a gleaming portfolio of successfully delivered software projects to prove they can deliver what they say they can.\n\nAdditional skills that they need to succeed in your software development project:\n\n*   The ability to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers;\n*   Code review technical skills;\n*   Familiarity with UI design principles.\n\n### How to hire Swift app developers?\n\nTake the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide whether to use a freelancer platform or a software development company when you hire\n\nThe hiring processes when hiring a Swift developer can be difficult. Unfortunately, you only find that out when you have hired a programmer with poor skills who has just made a huge mistake that is going to cost you a lot of time and money.\n\nMobile app development is a serious business, so you need to hire the best.\n\nGeneral-purpose freelancer sites provide access to thousands of part-time Swift freelancers. If you shop around, you can hire Swift developers at the lowest rates in the market. However, this comes with drawbacks.\n\nTo start with, these Swift freelancers are totally unmanaged and you must assume full responsibility for their work. A better option to overcome this issue is the development-focused freelancer platforms that have some form of vetting process in order to ensure developer quality. However, these still come with huge risks.\n\nKeep in mind that these developers are also only Swift freelancers and, like all freelancers, will be working on several other projects at once.\n\nAnother point is that they don’t come with a project manager or any project management support. This will mean that, if you are not careful, you might find yourself having to manage thee freelancers with time zone and language barriers, etc.\n\nThe best option is to hire a Swift developer or Swift dev team from a dedicated software development company like Fwork LLC. Not only are all these companies’ developers full-time, and so won’t be distracted by side projects, but the better companies also provide project management oversight and a dedicated account manager to oversee the work done by their developers. Make sure you get this service from whichever platform you hire from.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the software engineers\n\nInterview the candidates as comprehensively as your time will allow.\n\nNote that you won’t need to put much effort in should you hire from a dedicated software development company, as they do this for you.\n\nGet help from knowledgeable associates if you aren’t a Swift expert, or hire a Swift consultant to help you. You can use our [Swift interview questions](https://www.Fwork LLC/hiring-interview-tips/swift-interview-questions-and-answers/) when interviewing prospective development team members.\n\nFocus on your requirements when interviewing. E.g., you might have a project to develop iOS apps, so you will need to focus on the skills needed to develop iOS apps, etc.\n\nTo take another example, you might need senior software engineers. Likewise, tailor your interview process accordingly.\n\nFinally, explain your project and check how the candidate reacts and comes up with solutions for various parts of the project.\n\n#### 3\\. Onboard the software developers\n\nYou now reach the last part of the hiring process where you onboard Swift developers. The new developers should work as an effective Swift development team, therefore, the onboarding must be efficient, i.e. they are fully aware of everything they need to know and have access to all channels, team members, etc.\n\nExplain your project requirements. Provide the necessary documents. Give access to your project’s technical environment including the code repository.\n\nIntroduce the new team members to your existing team. Explain the roles and responsibilities, and describe how the new Swift developers can get help.\n\nDescribe the project plan, schedule, and iterations. Explain the review and quality management processes in your organization. Describe the approval process, and set up the necessary communication channels. Establish accountability.\n\n### Important tips when interviewing Swift programmers\n\nFocus on the following when looking for the top Swift developers:\n\n#### A. Knowledge of Swift coding best practices\n\nSwift offers powerful features, however, more important is its maintainability. The best Swift developers know how to utilize the maintainability features offered by Swift. Swift is one of the easiest programming languages in this regard.\n\nIf you are developing an iOS app, you want iOS developers that create maintainable apps. It reduces future maintenance costs. Look for Swift developers that have this ability.\n\n#### B. Knowledge of how Swift enables performance\n\nThe creators of Swift prioritized performance. Skilled Swift developers know how to use this strength effectively. Look for experience in coding performant Swift apps.\n\nThis is another reason for you to hire Swift developers from dedicated software development company. You will find it hard to verify the relevant experience of freelance Swift developers.\n\nFreelance Swift developers might provide an impressive project portfolio. However, you might not really know their effective contribution to those projects. This verification is even harder for remote Swift developers.\n\nHire experienced Swift developers from dedicated software development companies like Fwork LLC. You can easily verify their relevant project experience and the company guarentees their performance.\n\n#### C. In-depth knowledge of how Swift offers productivity\n\nSwift offers important features that reduce developers’ workload. Look for skilled Swift developers that know how to use them well. Your Swift team will benefit from huch higher productivity if you do.\n\n### Examples of interview questions when hiring Swift developers\n\nSo, now you know the skills that you are looking for, here are some questions that will help you to test the practical knowledge of the candidates. The following are a few examples:\n\n#### A. How does a structure differ from a class in Swift?\n\nAnswer: A Swift “Structure” or “Struct” is a value type. However, a Swift “Class” is a reference type.\n\nTake the example of an app to measure visibility on two different days. The app uses numeric values of “1” and “2” to compare visibilities. If you use Swift structures, then the code will look like the following:\n\n    struct Day {\n      var visibility: Int = 1\n    }\n    var day1 = Day()\n    var day2 = day1\n    Day2.visibility = 2.\n    \n\nYou have “day1.visibility” as 1 and “day2.visibility” as 2. Since you used a structure, the value types were copied by value.\n\nThe statement “var day2 = day1” copied “day1” and assigned it to “day2”. You can change “day2”, however, that won’t change “day1”.\n\nIf you use a class for “Day”, then it will be a reference type. If you change “Day2”, then that will also change “Day1”.\n\n#### B. Should you use “nil” or “.none” in Swift?\n\nAnswer: Although “nil” and “.none” function in the same way in Swift, the convention is to use “nil”. You should use “nil”.\n\n#### C. How can you handle runtime errors in Swift?\n\nAnswer: Swift offers numerous ways to handle runtime errors, e.g.:\n\n*   The Swift “error protocol”: Swift programmers can use a custom “Error” type, subsequently, they can use the appropriate enumeration.\n*   The “throws” and “throw” keywords: You can add the “throws” keyword in the definition of a function or an initializer. Subsequently, you can use the “throw” keyword to throw errors from the error type defined.\n*   The “do-catch” block and “try” statement: You can use a “do-catch” block including a “try” statement. Use this for functions with a “throws” keyword.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nIf you wish to learn more about how our expert Swift developers can help your project, simply fill out a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form and one of our dedicated account managers will get back to you to answer any questions you might have."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire PhoneGap Developers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOver a decade has passed since the release of PhoneGap, however, this hybrid app development framework still is in considerable demand. Also known as Apache Cordova, this open-source framework helps developers to build hybrid apps. Users of Android, iPhone, Blackberry, or a Windows phone can access hybrid apps.\n\nInstead of using an Android or iOS SDK to develop apps for those mobile platforms, hybrid app development involves technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. PhoneGap uses these web technologies in the same way that other popular cross-platform development frameworks do.\n\nMany programmers know these web development technologies, which reduces the learning curve. Ionic, another popular hybrid app development framework was built on top of Apache Cordova.\n\nQuite a few developers have learned PhoneGap, however, it can be hard to hire PhoneGap developers. You need to choose a hiring platform between freelancer platforms and software development companies.\n\n### Essential PhoneGap development skills\n\nYou need to look for the appropriate skills. A mobile developer with PhoneGap experience needs the following technical skills:\n\n*   Deep knowledge of the PhoneGap framework;\n*   Comprehensive JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 skills;\n*   Experience with the “Model-View-Controller” (MVC) design pattern;\n*   Knowledge of popular front-end web frameworks like AngularJS;\n*   In-depth knowledge of popular tools like Eclipse, GitHub, Ant, etc.;\n*   Knowledge of app store publishing processes.\n\n### Other skills that a PhoneGap application developer needs\n\nPhoneGap developers need a few more skills, which are as follows:\n\n#### A. API development skills\n\nCreating RESTful APIs helps the front-end of your web or mobile application access the back-end using a consistent framework. PhoneGap developers need to know the following:\n\n*   How to use API development and documentation tools;\n*   How to develop the backend using modern databases and how to host APIs on the cloud;\n*   Creating effective rules for API requests and responses.\n\n#### B. The knowledge of Android and iOS development\n\nNative apps use all device-specific features of the mobile devices for that platform, however, hybrid apps can’t do this. PhoneGap apps can’t match the native user experience (UX) and performance.\n\nLook for PhoneGap mobile app developers with the knowledge of native Android and iOS development. They should know about these operating systems. They need to know how to use native plugins to add more functionalities to the app, for example.\n\n#### C. Familiarity with cloud platforms\n\nCloud platforms can expedite your project. “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) or “Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service” (MBaaS) platforms can save time since they manage the infrastructure side of things. You can focus on development. Look for PhoneGap programmers that have worked on cloud platforms like AWS.\n\n#### E. The knowledge of application security\n\nA cross-platform app can’t match the security of native apps, therefore, you need to pay more attention to application security. Hire PhoneGap developers that know how to proactively identify application security vulnerabilities and mitigate them. They should know how to secure the 1st party APIs they code.\n\n#### G. The knowledge of successfully delivering app development services\n\nApplication developers also need the following skills and competencies to succeed in software development projects:\n\n*   Code review skills;\n*   The ability to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers;\n*   Familiarity with UI design principles;\n*   Software development process skills.\n\n### How to hire PhoneGap app developers?\n\nTake the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide whether to use a freelancer platform or a software development company for hiring\n\nIf you are the CTO in your company, then you need project execution to go to plan and on budget. Hiring the right kind of application developers is the key here. Incompetent PhoneGap programmers can adversely impact your schedule, cost, and quality objectives.\n\nGeneral-purpose freelancer sites can help you to hire part-time PhoneGap developers on an hourly basis. You might get developers at a low rate on such platforms. A few software development-focused freelancer platforms claim to use stringent screening processes, therefore, you can high-quality developers too. These platforms can’t provide full-time dedicated developers though.\n\nMoreover, these platforms don’t provide project management support. Managing part-time freelancers can be hard. For example, consider the challenges if you are in the United States and you need to manage the work of part-time freelancers in India.\n\nIf you have a complex mobile application development project, then you will surely need full-time developers. An app development company such as Fwork LLC can provide a dedicated team of PhoneGap experts as well as individual developers or dev teams.\n\nAs a full-time software development company, we provide a replacement developer if the original developer gets sick, etc. We also guarantee the quality of their work, if you are not 100% happy then you don’t need to pay. In addition to providing development solutions, we also secure your project’s sensitive data and sign an NDA. Carefully analyze your requirements before you make a hiring decision.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the candidates\n\nIt’s time to interview the candidates. If you know PhoneGap, then you can handle this. Otherwise, you might need to either ask an associate to interview the candidates or get interview questions from the Internet.\n\nYou need to cover all the skill areas we have mentioned. Ask the candidates about the complex projects that they have worked on and not just straight-forward projects like eCommerce development. Find out how they had dealt with the complexities.\n\nExplain your project requirements and ask them how they would approach it. Look for specific recommendations and not generic statements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide relevant details about your PhoneGap development project\n\nYou need to provide sufficient information about your project to developers. Provide the requirements, technical solutions, test plans, etc. Describe the project and introduce developers to your larger team. Explain the roles and responsibilities of developers.\n\nEstablish a communications process. Provide access to the technical environment of your project including the code repository. Explain your project schedule, milestones, the milestone review process, and the payment terms and conditions.\n\n#### 4\\. Important interviewing tips for hiring PhoneGap developers\n\nThe following interviewing tips when hiring software developers with PhoneGap skills and experience:\n\nA. Verify whether the candidates have avoided common errors during mobile development and web app development using PhoneGap.\n\nThe PhoneGap platform is JavaScript-based. JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language. That makes it highly flexible. However, inexperienced developers might make variable type-related errors.\n\nSuch errors can create security vulnerabilities in your app. You want to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, look for sufficiently experienced full-stack developers with PhoneGap experience. They know the tricks to avoid common coding errors.\n\nYou might find it hard to assess the real experience of freelancers. Consider hiring dedicated PhoneGap developers from companies providing credible PhoneGap development services. Fwork LLC is such a company with expert dedicated PhoneGap programmers.\n\nB. Assess how the candidates have closed the gaps with native development\n\nYou can take either native development or cross-platform development options for mobile app development. However, PhoneGap app development can’t really match the native user experience, performance, and security.\n\nExpert PhoneGap developers can close a few of the gaps while developing cross-platform mobile apps. They need a very thorough knowledge of mobile development though.\n\nAssessing the skills and experience of freelance PhoneGap developers can be hard. However, you don’t need to worry about this if you hire dedicated PhoneGap developers from companies like Fwork LLC. We follow stringent screening processes. Therefore, our community of developers has the requisite expertise.\n\n### Sample interview questions when hiring PhoneGap app developers.\n\nYou could hire top PhoneGap developers by assessing the practical knowledge of candidates during the interview. Ask questions that help you to gauge their technical expertise and experience.\n\nCheck out the following examples:\n\nA. Provide a list of PhoneGap events.\n\n**Answer:** PhoneGap events are as follows:\n\n“deviceready”;  \n“pause”;  \n“resume”;  \n“online”;  \n“offline”;  \n“backbutton”;  \n“batterycriticalbatterylow”;  \n“batterystatus”;  \n“menubutton”;  \n“searchbutton”;  \n“startcallbutton”;  \n“endcallbutton”;  \n“volumedownbutton”;  \n“volumeupbutton”.\n\nB. Which files does a PhoneGap plugin have?\n\n**Answer:** A PhoneGap plugin has a JavaScript file. It defines the functions for accessing the native hooks.  \nAdditionally, a PhoneGap plugin has implementation files written in the native programming language corresponding to the target operating system. This file is required for using the native device features.\n\nC. Specify a few important PhoneGap APIs.\n\n**Answer:** The following are a few important PhoneGap APIs:\n\n*   Accelerometer;\n*   Camera;\n*   Capture;\n*   Compass;\n*   Connection;\n*   Contacts;\n*   Device;\n*   Geo-location.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWe recommend that you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. A dedicated account manager will contact you for a risk-free consultation and explain how our PhoneGap developers can help you."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire AWS Developers\n----------------------------------------\n\n![AWS Developers](./3c395f768f9dc8bb35d11f0dcdca3700.svg)\n\nAre you looking for the best way to hire AWS developers? If so then uou have come to the right place.\n\nWhile other technology giants such as Google and Microsoft have their own powerful cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services or AWS has dominated the cloud services market for the last few decades.\n\nThere are clear reasons for this. The first and foremost reason is that AWS was the first to the cloud party. Suprisingly, it was not Microsoft or Google that had the vision for on-demand cloud computing but rather an online books retailer – Amazon. Investing heavily in cloud services, Amazon quickly got outfront and has never looked back.\n\nAWS cloud is cost-effective while offering a great range of services, capabilities, tools, and solutions. AWS is designed to make access to on-demand cloud computing resources easy for all.\n\nWhatever kind of project that you are looking to undertake, be it a web development or mobile development project, etc., AWS has a huge range of top-notch tools to help you.\n\nFor example, if you are developing a web solution, you can use AWS Elastics Beanstalk, i.e., the PaaS offering from AWS for your web application development. On the other hand, if you are developing a mobile application, you can use AWS Amplify, i.e., the MBaaS (Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service).\n\nIf you only want scalable computing capacity but not a PaaS or MBaaS platform, you can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and if you want an object storage service on the cloud, Amazon S3 is for you. Planning to set up, operate, and scale a relational database on the cloud? Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) can help you.\n\nI think you get the point.\n\nThe growing popularity of AWS has resulted in more and more developers using it. You might think that finding a great software developer with AWS skills will be easy, however, it’s not so. Since there are lots of developers out there, you need to know how to find those few great developers among the rest.\n\nWe suggest that you look for the following skills:\n\n### Essential AWS development skills\n\nYou need AWS developers that have the following skills:\n\n*   Knowledge and experience with the core AWS services, including the specific services that you plan to use in your project;\n*   Skills in Linux or Unix administration;\n*   AWS database migration skills;\n*   Experience with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS);\n*   Knowledge of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS);\n*   For a web development project, your developer needs the extensive experience of working on Java, Node.js or your choice of the programming language;\n*   For developing a mobile app, the programmer needs to have native Android/iOS development skills or React Native skills;\n*   Python skills for AI/ML development;\n*   Deep knowledge of application security in the cloud computing environment;\n*   In-depth knowledge of AWS information security services like Amazon Identity & Access Management (IAM), AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), Amazon Cognito, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Shield, AWS Key Management Service (KMS), AWS CloudHSM, etc.;\n*   Experience with AWS cloud monitoring solutions like Amazon CloudWatch;\n*   Deep knowledge of designing application systems and architecture patterns;\n*   Proven capability to troubleshoot distributed systems;\n*   In-depth knowledge of “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) and experience with AWS IaC solutions like AWS CloudFormation;\n*   Prior experience of designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining cloud-native apps;\n*   Deep knowledge of Amazon RDS;\n*   Familiarity with AWS platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Amplify, etc.;\n*   Experience with DevOps practices;\n*   Knowledge of AWS CI/CD tools like AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeStar, etc.;\n*   Familiarity with AWS Lambda, the Serverless computing platform provided by AWS.\n\n_Note that this isn’t an exhaustive list of skills. Your specific project requirements will determine the other skills you need. For example, if your project requires, then you might need skills with AWS services for IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc._\n\n### Other software development skills that AWS developers need\n\nTo be effective, AWS developers need some more skills. These are as follows:\n\n#### A. The skills to develop secure applications\n\nApplication security is crucial, and we can’t overstate its importance. You need developers that know how to code secure applications. They should know the following:\n\n*   How to identify and mitigate key application security vulnerabilities like injection, broken authentication, etc.;\n*   Utilizing modern tools/techniques/solutions like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, next-generation firewalls, etc.;\n*   How to secure APIs;\n*   The importance of proactively including compliance and security testing in the CI/CD pipeline instead of leaving them as the last set of tasks.\n\n#### B. The knowledge to develop 1st party APIs\n\nIn all likelihood, you will develop 1st party RESTful APIs as part of your application development. APIs allow the front-end of your app to access the back-end using a consistent framework. Thanks to APIs, you can also scale your software development processes.\n\nYou need developers that know the following:\n\n*   How to use modern API development and documentation tools;\n*   Using the AWS cloud platform to host APIs;\n*   How to use Amazon RDS and/or other NoSQL databases to build the back-end;\n*   Designing API endpoint URLs smartly;\n*   How to secure 1st party APIs with the help of tools and techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, digital signature, quotas, throttling, and secure gateways;\n*   How to create effective rules for API requests and responses.\n\n#### C. The knowledge and experience gained by delivering great software development projects\n\nSucceeding in a software development project requires much more than good technical skills in programming languages and tools. Developers learn a lot by working in complex projects, and AWS developers aren’t exceptions to this rule.\n\nYou need developers that know the following:\n\n*   How to meaningfully contribute to the software architecture design;\n*   How to code in line with the architectural decisions taken in the project;\n*   Coding in alignment with the user interface design principles used in the project;\n*   How to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers.\n\nWe can’t overstate the importance of code review here. Code reviews can identify defects early in the life cycle. It also unearths defects that testing can’t detect.\n\nApplication security vulnerabilities are prime examples of this. You will find it hard to detect these vulnerabilities during testing, however, code reviews can detect them. You need developers with experience in code review.\n\n### How to find competent AWS developers?\n\nNow you know the skills you should look for. You now need to start the hiring process. Take the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose a hiring platform you will use between freelancer platforms and software development companies\n\nWhen you undertake a crucial software development project, you need the right people. Hiring decisions make a significant impact since they determine what kind of people you get.\n\nThe first option is to use a general-purpose freelance site. These have the main advantages of having large networks of freelancers and the ability to negotiate a favorable hourly rate.\n\nHowever, freelancers often work on multiple projects simultaneously, therefore, they will work on your project only on a part-time basis. Time zone differences can make it hard, e.g., managing freelancers in an eastern European country can be hard if you are in the western United States, for example.\n\nPlatforms often deduct up to 20% of the freelancers’ income, which acts as a demotivating factor. They also don’t provide any management support.\n\nThe second option is to use a freelance platform that focuses primarily on software development. You can get high-quality developers from these platforms thanks to their stringent screening process.\n\nWhile that’s an advantage, they don’t provide any management support. You need to mitigate the risks of working with freelancers.\n\nThe best option is to use a reputed software development company like Fwork LLC. We offer dedicated AWS developers that work full-time for our company on your project should you require it.\n\nWe provide comprehensive project management support and replace any developer should they fall sick, etc. We also take the security of your sensitive data seriously. We implement physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to secure your sensitive data.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nAssuming you have chosen a hiring platform, you now need to interview the candidates. You can interview them if you are an AWS expert. If you aren’t, then you can ask a knowledgeable associate to interview the candidates. The other option is to find interview questions on the Internet.\n\nCover all the technical skills we have mentioned. Review the portfolios of the candidates carefully and identify the complex projects that they have worked on. Ask them how they have dealt with the complexities.\n\nExplain your project requirements and ask them how they would approach your project. You should expect them to provide detailed and specific responses. Watch out for generic responses since they could indicate a lack of hands-on knowledge. Candidates with years of experience on AWS will know how to provide a specific solution to most business requirements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your application development project\n\nAn AWS developer will need sufficient information to successfully deliver your project. This is true even for an AWS professional with years of experience. You now need to provide all relevant information about this project.\n\nStart with the business requirements of your project. Provide the business and technical requirement documents to the AWS developer. The developer needs to know the software architectural decisions in your project, therefore, provide relevant documentation.\n\nYou need to provide relevant documentation that explains your information security requirements. The AWS developer you choose needs to know about your test plans. Your database management requirements are the other important documentation that you need to provide.\n\nIntroduce the AWS developer to your larger team. Explain the team structure. Take sufficient time to explain the roles and responsibilities of the developer. Provide access to the technical environment of your project. Establish a communication process.\n\nAs the next step, explain your project plan and schedule. You will probably have multiple iterations in your project, therefore, you need to explain them to the developer.\n\nEstablish accountability measures. Describe the milestone review process in your project. Explain how you will pay, including the payment terms and conditions.\n\n### Interview tips to hire AWS engineers\n\nKeep the following interview tips in mind when hiring AWS developers:\n\n#### A. Decide early on the cloud computing services that you need\n\nWe strongly recommend that you decide early on the AWS technologies and AWS resources that you need. You can find better AWS developers then since you can focus on the important skills.\n\nLeading cloud computing platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure provide a lot of cloud infrastructure and other services. That includes storage, database, cloud migration, and much more.\n\nYou don’t really need every one of them in your app development project! Even the top AWS developers and experienced AWS consultants don’t know about all of the AWS services.\n\nDon’t get overwhelmed by the breadth of cloud computing services offered by AWS. Analyze the skills that you really need for your project and business processes. Put these well-thought-out requirements on AWS job boards.\n\n#### B. Resist the urge of hiring developers just because they want microservices!\n\nYou need software developers that understand what works best for you. There’s talk among many developers and architects about why microservices architecture is great. The microservices architecture pattern might indeed be very useful in many cases. However, don’t just jump onto the “microservices bandwagon”.\n\nAssess whether this architecture pattern works for you. Don’t think that some candidates are highly skilled AWS developers just because they advocate microservices.\n\n#### C. Look for software engineers with experience in using popular NoSQL databases on AWS\n\nMany software developers might want to use Amazon DynamoDB, the popular NoSQL Key-Value database. It’s easy to use on an AWS project too. However, keep in mind that NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Apache Cassandra are very popular too.\n\nBest AWS developers know how to use the right NoSQL database for your project. Look for developers that have used a variety of NoSQL databases on AWS.\n\n### Examples of interview questions when hiring AWS professionals\n\nAsk questions that help you to judge practical knowledge. Check out the following examples:\n\n#### A. Which AWS solution can you utilize to monitor the performance of your application system?\n\nAnswer: You can use Amazon CloudWatch. It offers relevant metrics to track the performance of application systems. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to implement monitoring of resources like Amazon EC2 instances. You can see reports and set up alarms.\n\n#### B. Does AWS allow you to modify security group rules that are used by multiple EC2 instances?\n\nAnswer: AWS allows you to modify such security group rules. It implements the changes immediately, and you don’t need to restart the instances.\n\n#### C. Why will you lifecycle hooks for auto-scaling?\n\nAnswer: Lifecycle hooks carry out custom actions when an auto-scaling group launches or terminates an instance. The pause instances. You can install software products of your choice or check the readiness of the instance when it’s paused.\n\nRead our AWS interview questions for more examples.\n\nThat’s it! You are now ready to set your new developer working.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWhy don’t you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form? A dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will contact you and explain the value that our experienced AWS developers can offer."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Ruby on Rails Developers\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n![Ruby On Rails Developers](./41602e922d3815f693ed0290206b09bb.svg)\n\nThe creators of Ruby on Rails declared it an open-source framework in 2004, and it has gained considerable popularity since then. It’s a powerful framework that can help you do a lot very quickly.\n\nFor example, you can easily create a peer-to-peer video calling app like Skype using Ruby on Rails. You can also create modern apps using AngularJS on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend.\n\nIts ease of use and popularity has prompted many programmers to learn Ruby on Rails over the years. You can certainly find lots of Ruby on Rails programmers out there today. This might give the impression that you can easily hire developers for a Rails project. In reality, hiring such developers is more complex.\n\nThe key to resolving this dilemma lies in carefully reviewing your project and business requirements. Before that, another key question demands your attention. How best to evaluate a Ruby on Rails developer? We suggest that you look for the following skills:\n\n### Ruby on Rails framework skills\n\nIn many ways, Ruby on Rails is quite different from other server-side web development frameworks. You are using this framework primarily to reduce the time and effort you need to build a web application.\n\nConsider the focus on “convention over configuration” in Ruby on Rails. If you follow the naming conventions that the framework suggests, then you don’t need to write lengthy configuration-related code. This can save a lot of time for developers. However, programmers need to know the framework quite well to take advantage of its strengths.\n\nLook for developers with the following skills:\n\n*   Ruby on Rails framework;\n*   Common libraries like Capybara, RSpec, and Resque;\n*   Ruby syntax and its intricacies;\n*   Object-oriented programming;\n*   Server-side templating languages like Liquid;\n*   Server-side CSS processing.\n\n### Other development skills associated with RoR application development\n\nEffective Ruby on Rails programmers need to have a few more skills too. Look for the following sills:\n\n*   JavaScript, which is a powerful programming language for front-end development;\n*   HTML5 and CSS3;\n*   The knowledge of concepts like “Model-View-Controller” (MVC), “Object Relational Management”  \n    (ORM) frameworks, etc.;\n*   Minitest, a popular testing tool for Ruby.\n\n_Note: Depending on your business requirements, you could offer features that use cutting-edge technologies. You would then need to look for associated skills, which aren’t necessarily Ruby on Rails skills. For example, look for Python skills if you require “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) development. Here, we focus on Ruby on Rails and associated skills._\n\n### Other software development skills\n\nA successful Ruby on Rails developer will need several other skills too, which are as follows:\n\n#### A. Application security skills\n\nYou will likely process some form of sensitive data in your web app. Given the focus on data security and privacy these days, you would need to secure your app. Look for the following skills:\n\n*   The ability to mitigate key application security vulnerabilities like injection, broken authentication, etc.;\n*   The knowledge of tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, etc.;\n*   The skills to secure the 1st party APIs;\n*   The knowledge of best practices related to coding.\n\nA full-stack web developer or a mobile app developer must know lots about application security if your product is to be secure.\n\n#### B. API development skills\n\nYou need RESTful API development skills when you hire Ruby on Rails developers. Note that we aren’t talking about 3rd party APIs here, rather, we are talking about developing your own 1st party APIs.\n\nAPIs help the front-end of your app to access the back-end using a consistent framework. You can also scale your development process with the help of APIs. “REST”, which stands for “Representational State Transfer”, is the de-facto standard for API development.\n\nHire Rails experts that can use appropriate tools for API development. They should be able to use modern databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. to create the backend. You will likely use a cloud platform, and they should be able to host APIs using it.\n\nThe Ruby developer you hire needs to secure the APIs they develop. Such a developer should know how to use tools and techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, digital signature, quotas, throttling, etc. for this. Knowledgeable developers should know how to design API endpoint URLs smartly, moreover, they should be able to formulate effective rules for API requests and responses.\n\n#### C. The familiarity with cloud platforms\n\nLook for developers that have familiarity with cloud platforms. Using a cloud platform can help you to focus on design and development instead of infrastructure management. Since you are developing a web application, you can use a “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platform.\n\nPopular PaaS platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku manage the cloud infrastructure, networking, storage, operating system, middleware, and runtime environment. This enables you to focus on development.\n\nSuch reputed PaaS platforms typically offer robust DevOps tools. They help you to integrate APIs and scale your app. The good news is that most of the experienced Ruby on Rails developers know about these PaaS platforms.\n\n#### D. The skills to deliver software development projects successfully\n\nYou need developers that know how to make your project a success. Look for the following skills:\n\n*   Code review: Code review can catch many defects that testing can’t. Application security vulnerabilities are prominent examples.\n*   Coding in alignment with the UI design: A successful programmer knows how to code in perfect alignment with the UI design.\n*   Coding in line with the architectural decisions: Experienced programmers know that their code should align with the software architectural decisions in the project.\n*   Collaboration: Effective programmers proactively collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers so that the project can have an effective CI/CD environment.\n\n### How to find the best Ruby on Rails developer?\n\nNow that you know the skills you should look for, you need to start the hiring process.\n\nMake no mistake! Ruby on Rails is an easy-to-use and versatile framework, however, web development using this framework isn’t necessarily easy. Of course, developing an eCommerce app could be easy. However, most projects tend to be more complex.\n\nYour hiring decisions directly influence the success of your web application development project. Choose your hiring platform carefully.\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire Ruby on Rails developers\n\nFreelancer sites are very popular for small projects. While they don’t focus exclusively on software development, these platforms have large networks of freelancers. You can hire Ruby on Rails  \ndevelopers on these platforms, moreover, you might even be able to negotiate a low rate.\n\nThese platforms don’t provide any project management support though. Freelancers try to earn more by working on multiple projects simultaneously which can cause delays and problems. Some deduct fees of up to 20% which can be demotivating to freelancers.\n\nAlternatively, some freelancer platforms focus specifically on software development, and many have a developer vetting process. This is good news as you are more likely to get programmers of a higher quality.\n\nUnfortunately, these platforms don’t provide any management support so you need to manage the risks associated with freelancers. Managing time zone differences can be hard even with full-time developers, and it’s certainly harder with part-time freelancers.\n\nThe best option is to hire a developer through a software development company such as Fwork LLC. We can provide Ruby on Rails developers for your application development project.\n\nOur efficient and transparent contracting processes can help your recruiter dramatically cut down the lead in time to onboarding a great developer. Fwork LLC also implements  \ntechnical, procedural, and physical safeguards to protect your sensitive data. For example, we make our developers sign a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” (NDA).\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nAfter you choose a hiring platform, you need to interview the shortlisted candidates. Get someone with knowledge of Ruby on Rails if you don’t know this framework enough. You can also find interview questions on the Internet.\n\nIn addition to covering all the skill areas we have mentioned, you need to evaluate the project experience of the candidate. Check whether they have worked on complex projects and ask how they dealt with the complexities. You could ask them to show the apps they developed using the Rails framework.\n\nExplain your project requirements and ask them to explain how they would approach the project. Don’t satisfy yourself with anything but comprehensive responses. Ask them to show tangible aspects of how they would achieve your project requirements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your application development project\n\nInformation is the key to the success of any product development, and your developers need it too. Provide all the information relevant to the project, which includes requirements and design documents. You need to explain the roles and responsibilities, deliverables, and the technical environment clearly.\n\nGive access to all the relevant tools like your GitHub repository. Explain your quality management processes, milestones, communication process, and the payment T&Cs. Introduce the developers you hire to your existing team and foster a spirit of collaboration. Establish accountability standards and measures.\n\n### Interview tips for hiring Ruby on Rails developers\n\nKeep the following interview tips in mind when you hire RoR developers:\n\n#### A. Look for RoR developers that can code high-quality apps\n\nRemember that Ruby is a dynamically typed language. That makes Ruby highly flexible and Ruby on Rails very powerful. However, inexperienced developers working on Rails development projects can make variable type-related errors.\n\nYou need sufficiently experienced developers in a Rails development project. That’s easier said than done! Assessing the real experience of developers can be hard. It’s harder if you interview freelancers.\n\nTherefore, hire RoR developers from companies like Fwork LLC that provide credible Ruby on Rails development services. Trusted Rails services companies like us do the “heavy lifting” for you by vetting programmers.\n\n#### B. Prioritize productivity when hiring an RoR developer\n\nA great advantage of Ruby on Rails is the productivity gain that it offers. You should indeed try to maximize the productivity of your Ruby on Rails development teams. For this, you need to hire Ruby developers with in-depth knowledge of the framework.\n\nHiring RoR developers like that can be hard if you look for freelancers. You will find it hard to assess the relevant experience of freelance Ruby on Rails developers.\n\nTherefore, hire from a trusted Rails development company like Fwork LLC. We already follow stringent screening measures for our developers.\n\n#### C. Focus on the important Ruby on Rails developer’s skills and not everything else\n\nRemember that Ruby on Rails is a highly popular open-source framework. Also, Ruby is known as an exciting one among programming languages.\n\nTherefore, many Ruby developers enthusiastically create excellent open-source tools for it. Ruby on Rails engineers have a wide choice of useful tools to use.\n\nHowever, you don’t need all of these tools for all RoR web development projects. You will likely need only a few that cater to your software development project well.\n\nLook for skills on those relevant tools only. Even the top Ruby on Rails developers don’t know every one of the open-source tools for RoR. Prioritize and focus on the important skills only.\n\n### Sample interview questions for hiring Ruby on Rails programmers\n\nFocus on assessing the hands-on knowledge of Ruby on Rails programmers, and ask questions accordingly. Check out the following examples of interview questions:\n\n#### A. State a few examples of Ruby on Rails scripts?\n\nAnswer: Some of the common Ruby on Rails scripts are Rails Console, WEBrick Web Server, Generators, and Migrations.\n\n#### B. What is the syntax to define a “controller” in Ruby on Rails?\n\nAnswer: The syntax is as follows:\n\n    class ClientsController < ApplicationController\n      def new\n      end\n    end\n    \n\n#### C. Can garbage collection issues cause security issues in an RoR app?\n\nAnswer: Yes, garbage collection issues can create security issues. There are immortal symbols in Ruby. The garbage collection process doesn’t work on these. There’s a possibility that many immortal symbols will be created in an app. Cybercriminals can exploit them to launch a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.\n\nReview our Ruby on Rails interview questions and answers for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nRuby on Rails is a very promising framework, however, creating an app using it can often be complex. You should hire developers with all the relevant experience and skills.\n\nWhy not take a few minutes and fill out our [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form and a dedicated account manager will contact you to tell you more about our process and the expert Ruby on Rails developers in our Fwork LLC community."

					"article": "How to Hire Facebook API Developers\n-----------------------------------\n\n![Facebook API Developers](./6bd935ba84e7eed308544f55d44d03bd.webp)\n\nFortunately, there are lots of developers out there who have experience in Facebook API development.\n\nYou can take the risk and hire from freelance sites or focus specifically on freelance platforms that specialize in software development.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a more complex project, the best solution is to outsource your development to a software development company that has all the developers and skill sets to make sure it is a success.\n\nThe first step is to have a clear understanding of your project requirements. This will allow you to understand exactly what you need in your Facebook API developer.\n\n### Essential Facebook API Developer Skills\n\nWith this project scope in mind, you can now evaluate your developers according to the following 5 skills.\n\n#### 1\\. Knowledge of Facebook APIs and SDKs\n\nEvaluate whether developers have in-depth expertise in the following:\n\n*   The Facebook Graph API: Programmers need to use this API to read and write to the Facebook social graph. This API allows apps to access pages, users, posts, groups, events, etc.\n*   The Facebook Marketing APIs: You can use Facebook Marketing APIs to manage your ad campaigns, create custom audiences, get reports, etc.\n\nDepending on your project, you could use one of the several SDKs that Facebook offers. Facebook offers the following SDKs:\n\n*   Android SDK;\n*   iOS SDK;\n*   SDK for PC games;\n*   PHP SDK;\n*   Facebook Business SDK, which helps you to manage your ad campaigns;\n*   React SDK;\n*   Swift SDK;\n*   tvOS SDK, which helps you to develop apps for Apple TV;\n*   Unity SDK, which helps you to develop cross-platform games.\n\nEvaluate whether the developer you are interviewing knows the SDKs relevant to your project.\n\n#### 2\\. Programming Language Skills\n\nYou will no doubt want to develop a software solution that uses Facebook APIs for certain features. As a result, you need developers with appropriate programming language skills for developing this solution. Depending on your project scope, you might need one or more of the following:\n\n**A. Web Application Development Skills**\n\nYou need web developers if your project scope includes web app development. In that case, you might need Node.js skills. This open-source runtime environment is an excellent choice to develop scalable and performant web apps.\n\n**B. Native Android Development Skills**\n\nIf you plan to develop a native Android app that uses Facebook APIs, then you need native Android developers. Java has been the mainstay for native Android development for a long time. In recent years, Kotlin has emerged as a popular choice.\n\nRead more about which to choose in our guide “[Kotlin vs Java: Which is the best choice?](/blog/kotlin-vs-java-which-is-the-best-choice/)”.\n\n**C. Native iOS Development Skills**\n\nYou might be developing a native iOS app as part of your project. Native iOS developers have used Objective-C for a long time, however, Swift has emerged as a popular choice in recent years.\n\nFortunately, there are huge numbers of developers out there who are well versed in these two programming languages.\n\n**D. React Native Development Skills**\n\nDepending on your project scope and budget, you could choose to develop a near-native mobile app using React Native. While it can’t exactly match the native user experience and performance, React Native has gained a lot of popularity and as such more and more developers are working with it.\n\n**E. AI/ML/Analytics Skills**\n\nIf you are developing AI/ML or analytics apps as part of your project, then you will need Python developers. Since the project scope is going to be more complex, you are likely to need more than one developer.\n\nIn such cases, it is important to hire through dedicated software development platforms only.\n\nThe underlying process of finding developers with the right skills is essentially the same. We will cover this in the interview section at the end.\n\n#### 3\\. The Knowledge of Coding Secure Applications\n\nYour product will likely deal with users’ Facebook data and other social media data from platforms like Instagram.\n\nIn addition to aggregate data like Google Analytics, you might also process personal data. With the growing concerns around data breaches, you need to pay attention to application security.\n\nThis means that you need developers that know how to code secure applications. This includes the following skills:\n\n*   Programmers need to know how to mitigate key application security vulnerabilities by following the best practices for application development.\n*   If they develop 1st party REST APIs, then they need to understand how to secure them using access tokens.\n*   They should have good knowledge of how to use tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication, encryption, etc.\n\n#### 4\\. The Knowledge of How to Succeed in a Software Development Project\n\nYou need programmers that know how to succeed in a development project of your size.\n\nFor example, if your project is a complex one, developers should have experience working on complex projects and in large teams before.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale, if you are only hiring a single developer then they need to have good communication skills and be able to provide regular update reports on their own.\n\nConsider the following examples:\n\n*   While a UI designer would design the front-end of the application, developers should know how to reflect that design and the functionality of the UI in their code.\n*   A software architect will decide on the architecture pattern most suitable for the app. All programmers should know how to code in perfect alignment with the architectural decisions.\n*   Competent developers should know how to work with testers and DevOps engineers in a spirit of collaboration. This will ensure timely fixing of code defects, meaning that you will be able to keep a steady pace of sprint completions.\n*   Capable programmers know how to develop scalable and performant apps.\n\n#### 5\\. Code Review Expertise\n\nEven a first-time project manager knows the importance of testing, however, some don’t realize automated testing won’t unearth all the defects in a piece of software.\n\nSince it is important to identify defects as early as possible, you need to hire a developer who is able to identify and fix defects early in the project lifecycle, or preferably not to make them in the first place.\n\nCode review plays an important part here since it can identify defects that automated testers might miss. So other than being able to write great code, a developer should be able to review their own code and spot defects and bugs.\n\nIt is handy to find a developer who has plenty of code review experience. This might be only part-time reviewing other people’s code to make a little extra money or working full-time for a specialist code review platform.\n\nExperienced code reviewers become expert programmers.\n\nThey know how to prevent defects by following coding guidelines, are able to quickly find application security vulnerabilities, and most of all know how to avoid many of the pitfalls that create bugs and security flaws in the first place.\n\n### How to Find the Best Facebook API Developer?\n\nNow that you understand the main skills that your developer will need to succeed with your new app, here are the basic steps that you need to take to find that great developer.\n\n#### Choose Which Platform to Use\n\nHaving been involved in the salvage of numerous poorly undertaken software development projects, Fwork LLC strongly recommends that you avoid hiring cheap freelancers from general-use freelancer sites.\n\nHowever, if money is at a premium and you need to go the low-budget route, then such sites offer direct access to software developers both in the United States and worldwide.\n\nKeep in mind that these sites do not offer protection, project management (PM) tools, and take as much as 20% of the developer’s income themselves.\n\nA much better option is the software development-specific freelancer site. They usually vet their developers to ensure quality. Naturally, such sites are a little more than general freelancer sites.\n\nThe drawback to the software-focused freelance site is that they don’t offer much in the way of help after they connect you with your developer. There is no developer managerial oversight or tools to help development, for example.\n\nWhile building a Facebook API solution is not the most complicated software development project, it is no less important to get it right.\n\nSoftware development companies offer both reliability and the option to take a vast amount of the stress off the project owner’s shoulders too. The best ones have full-time developers and not freelancers. They will sign NDAs with you to protect your property and if you are not happy, you don’t need to pay.\n\n#### Start Interviewing Potential Developers\n\nOnce you have found the best platform or software development companies, it is time to see what is out there and sign up for the developer you want.\n\nThe key here is to do your research. If you are not a software developer then hit Google and start to collect a series of questions that will help you assess a candidate’s skill set. Be sure to cover all the points in our list above.\n\nMake sure to ask about past projects that they have been involved in and what their role was. Ideally, you will want to test out the software wherever possible to get an idea of its scope and effectiveness.\n\nSome startups or companies ask the developer to complete a mini-test project to ensure that they are what they say they are. Expect to have to pay for this should your task take more than 30 minutes to an hour to complete.\n\n#### Explain the Project Until They Know it Back and Front\n\nThe final step before you set your developer roling is to ensure that they understand your project, your work approach, and what they are expected to do.\n\nGo through your project specification, set up communication channels, cover things like where your code will be kept, what they are expected to do (including when there are roadblocks, etc.), and how sprints and payments will work.\n\nWe strongly suggest that you agree that no sprints will be paid for until you are completely satisfied with the work and that all agreed deliverables have been completed.\n\n### Interview tips for hiring Facebook API developers\n\nWhen you hire a Facebook API developer, keep the following interview tips in mind:\n\n#### A. A Facebook API development team should manage the external dependencies well\n\nYou are consuming a Facebook API. You might have a web development or mobile application development project where you need it. Effectively, you are adding an external dependency. That’s the same if you consume any other external API like Google API.\n\nYou need a team with the appropriate software development experience. The software engineers in your team should be able to manage the external dependencies.\n\nHiring Facebook API experts from companies like Fwork LLC puts you at advantage. Such companies extensively screen their developers.\n\n#### B. Top Facebook API developers should be able to manage the complexities\n\nEvery 3rd party API you consume increases the degree of complexity of your application. Whether you consume a REST API or GraphQL API isn’t important here. If you develop all APIs as a part of the backend development, then you control the development fully. That’s not the case if you don’t build web services or APIs yourself.\n\nLook for experienced Facebook API developers with experience in handling complex projects. We at Fwork LLC can provide Facebook API experts with the requisite experience.\n\n#### C. Look for talented developers with deep knowledge of application security\n\nYou will likely consume Facebook APIs for web and mobile development. In addition to Facebook API experts, you will have web and mobile app developers on the team. That could include Android and iOS developers.\n\nLook for in-depth application security knowledge. Best Facebook API developers should know how to securely consume the APIs. The web and mobile developers should know that as well.\n\n### Examples of interview questions for hiring Facebook API developers\n\nAsk questions that help you to assess the relevant experience. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### A. Which Facebook Graph API queries can you use with the Facebook Ads API?\n\n**Answer:** You can use the following Graph API queries in the Ads API:\n\n*   Broad target categories;\n*   Connection objects;\n*   Ad statistics;\n*   Keyword stats;\n*   Reach Estimate;\n*   Autocomplete data.\n\n#### B. List the steps to register and configure an app to use Facebook APIs.\n\n**Answer:** You need to take the following steps:\n\n*   Login to Facebook;\n*   Create a developer account;\n*   Create a new app;\n*   Provide the app details;\n*   Select a platform;\n*   Configure the “advanced” settings;\n*   Assign developer roles;\n*   Create users for testing;\n*   Update the app development status;\n*   Submit your app for a review.\n\n#### C. Explain the rules for using test users.\n\n**Answer:** The rules for using test users are as follows:\n\n*   You can have up to 2,000 test users.\n*   Test users can’t “Like” or “Follow” the public Facebook pages. They can’t post on the timeline.\n*   Test users can submit comments on the posts administered by an app. This can be done by using the Graph API or the Facebook “Share” dialog.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nDeveloping new Facebook API solutions is as much a challenge as any other area of software development. For this, you will need a good Facebook API developer.\n\nWhy not begin your search by completing a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. After you have done so, a dedicated account manager will get back to you to answer any queries you might have and show you our most suitable developers for your project."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Salesforce Developers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOver two decades have passed since Salesforce emerged on the scene.  During this time, it has seen its popularity grow by leaps and bounds. This is why the race is on to hire Salesforce developers in USA and elsewhere.\n\nSalesforce.com is a big name in the world of cloud computing and customer relationship management (CRM), and there are good reasons for this.\n\nBusinesses have used the Salesforce platform to benefit from its numerous advantages, some of which include:\n\n*   Empowered customer service agents;\n*   Sales teams working smarter than before;\n*   Faster business growth;\n*   Improved marketing;\n*   More engaged customers;\n*   Good pool of Salesforce developers for hire.\n\nWhether you are running an e-Commerce business or a large enterprise offering market-leading products, Salesforce is a great choice to aid you with your product development.\n\nDevelopers also get enormous benefits from Salesforce cloud development too. The Salesforce ecosystem is incredibly rich. For example, if you are undertaking a web development project, then you will likely use a “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platform. Heroku is one of the first names that come to mind when you think of PaaS platforms, and it’s a part of Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce provides excellent development tools for its community cloud platform. The company has a comprehensive certification program too. As such, Salesforce-certified developers are in high demand. Businesses need to pay high rates if they plan to hire a Salesforce consultant or a Salesforce administrator. Certified Salesforce developers are at a premium in the United States.\n\nGiven this, developers take great interest in learning Salesforce. However, due to the demand from companies hiring Salesforce developers, you could find it hard to hire a Salesforce developer, particularly at short notice.\n\nYou need to choose between the different hiring platforms – freelance platforms or hybrid software development companies that hire Salesforce developers out to companies.\n\nYou can find part-time Salesforce developers on freelance platforms, however, working with Salesforce freelancers can expose you to certain risks. Hybrid software development companies offer full-time Salesforce developers, which helps if you have a complex Salesforce app development project. We will talk about this shortly.\n\nYou need to ensure that your Salesforce developer has the following technical skills:\n\n### Essential Salesforce development skills\n\n*   Apex: This is a proprietary language that was created by Salesforce.com. Developers can use this strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language to execute the transaction control system on the Force.com platform. They can also use it to execute the flow of a business process.\n*   Visualforce: Salesforce developed Visualforce for front-end development, which helps developers to design and build custom user interfaces on the Salesforce Lightning platform. It’s a web development framework and programmers can use it to build user interfaces for web applications. They can use it to create a UI for a mobile app or desktop app too.\n*   SOQL: SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) is similar to SQL, and developers can use it to search the Salesforce database.\n*   SOSL: SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) offers developers a programmatic way to execute text-based searches against a search index.\n*   Salesforce administration: You need to hire Salesforce developers that have experience working as a Salesforce administrator.\n*   Designing skills: The experience in designing objects, fields, page layouts, workflows, etc. is important for a Salesforce developer.\n*   Salesforce search solutions: Salesforce provides powerful search solutions. Developers that know them can expedite a project far more efficiently.\n*   Salesforce Developer Console: Salesforce Developer Console helps developers considerably. It’s an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that has an impressive collection of tools. Developers can use it to create, debug, and test Salesforce applications.\n\nWe recommend that you look for developers that have a Salesforce certification.\n\n### Other app development skills that a Salesforce developer needs\n\nYou should look for a few more skills when you hire Salesforce developers, and these skills are as follows:\n\n#### A. Key programming language skills\n\nWhile Salesforce development relies on Visualforce, Apex, SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language), and SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language), effective Salesforce programmers need a few more programming language skills. These languages are as follows:\n\n*   Java;\n*   JavaScript;\n*   HTML;\n*   CSS;\n*   SQL.\n\nSound knowledge in these will help them in Salesforce app development or web development using Salesforce.\n\n#### B. The knowledge of Salesforce Lightning\n\nYou need developers with the knowledge of Salesforce Lightning. The Salesforce Lightning platform allows developers to create cloud applications quickly. It also enables developers to deploy applications quickly.\n\nThis platform offers excellent tools so that Salesforce developers can create reliable, secure, and scalable cloud apps. It also offers tools to integrate with external applications, automate business processes, and deliver a mobile user experience.\n\nSalesforce Lightning platform developers should know the following:\n\n*   How to use the drag-and-drop app builder tools;\n*   Customizing data models;\n*   How to write apps on the Lightning platform using Apex;\n*   Using the Lightning platform APIs.\n\nLook for a Lightning platform developer with Salesforce certification.\n\n#### C. Comprehensive knowledge of Salesforce integration\n\nYou need developers with Salesforce integration skills. They need a thorough understanding of the various approaches for integrating with the Salesforce Force.com platform. These approaches correspond to the various layers of applications, namely, user interface, business logic, security, and data.\n\n#### D. The experience of customizing Salesforce applications\n\nSalesforce offers several customization options which benefit businesses enormously. You need developers with considerable experience in customizing Salesforce applications. They should know the following:\n\n*   How to customize reports;\n*   How to develop Visualforce pages, triggers, custom views, page layouts, custom workflows, and Apex classes;\n*   Building custom consoles;\n*   How to customize the Salesforce1 mobile app;\n*   Integrating other apps with the Salesforce environment of the client’s organization.\n\n#### E. The knowledge of application security\n\nSalesforce projects typically process confidential information. As with any application processing sensitive or confidential data, application security plays an important part. You need developers that know how to code secure apps. They need to know the coding best practices, moreover, they should be able to identify application security vulnerabilities.\n\n#### F. In-depth knowledge of the Salesforce cloud capabilities\n\nTo be effective, a Salesforce developer needs to have a thorough knowledge of the considerable cloud capabilities that Salesforce has. Such an in-depth understanding will help in many ways. For example, they can implement CRM solutions more effectively by utilizing Salesforce cloud capabilities.\n\nSalesforce Service Cloud is a great example. It can help businesses to transform their customer service operations. Businesses can use it to boost agent productivity, improve case tracking, provide better support via social media channels, and improve customer experience.\n\nSalesforce Sales Cloud supports sales, marketing, and customer support. Salesforce Marketing Cloud is yet another example.\n\nSalesforce has matured cloud capabilities in several other functional areas. A Salesforce expert that knows the Salesforce cloud capabilities can formulate effective Salesforce solutions for the organizational business needs.\n\n#### G. The knowledge of succeeding in a Salesforce development project\n\nTo be effective, a Salesforce developer needs the following additional skills:\n\n*   Knowledge of using editors like Eclipse or MavensMate on the Force.com platform;\n*   The ability to understand business requirements and translate them into viable technical solutions;\n*   Knowledge of software architecture;\n*   Understanding of RESTful APIs including how to develop and secure them;\n*   Problem-solving skills;\n*   The ability to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers;\n*   Code review experience.\n\n### How to find Salesforce developers?\n\nNow that we have explained the skills that you need to look for, you now need to take the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose between freelancer platforms and software development companies to hire Salesforce developers\n\nYour hiring decisions will have an important impact on your Salesforce application development project. If you hire expert Salesforce developers, you will likely execute a painless and successful project development. On the other hand, incompetent or only partially focused Salesforce developers can impact the quality, cost, and schedule objectives of your project.\n\nTurning around troubled projects can take time. Therefore, hire good Salesforce developers so that your project doesn’t become troubled in the first place.\n\nFreelancer platforms can connect you to part-time freelance Salesforce developers. You can bargain and get a good rate, however, you cannot be sure of what you are getting. Also, remember that these freelancer platforms don’t offer any management support.\n\nWorking with part-time Salesforce freelancers can be hard since they work on multiple projects simultaneously. Freelance platforms deduct a considerable part of their pay, which can demotivate them. While freelancer platforms focusing exclusively on software development can give you access to high-quality developers, you still need to manage the other risks.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrid software development companies such as Fwork LLC provides you with full-time Salesforce developers. Having dedicated developers can be very useful if you are executing a complex project. Fwork LLC guarantees the work of your developer, including offering a replacement in the case of sickness.\n\nNote that software development companies treat your sensitive and confidential information with care. They implement numerous safeguards to secure this information. For example, they will make their developers sign a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” (NDA) when they work with you. Analyze your business needs carefully before choosing a hiring platform.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the candidates\n\nBefore hiring Salesforce developers, you will need to interview the candidates. You can do this yourself if you know Salesforce well enough, if not get your project manager to do it.\n\nIf you don’t have Salesforce development skills in your organization, outsource a Salesforce consultant to do the interviews for you. Alternatively, you can ask an associate to interview them or get interview questions from the Internet. Please see the following section for some examples.\n\nYou need to cover all the skill areas we have mentioned. Pay attention to each Salesforce candidate’s portfolio and focus on the complex projects that they have worked on. Ask them about how they navigated the complexities and what they have learned.\n\nDescribe the business needs of your project and ask them how they would approach it. You should expect specific responses with insightful recommendations.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide relevant details about your Salesforce development project\n\nYou need to give sufficient information about your project to your hired Salesforce developers. Provide them with the business requirements, technical solutions, test strategies, and other relevant documents.\n\nIntroduce them to your larger Salesforce development team. Take time and explain their roles and responsibilities. Provide access to the technical environment of your project including code repositories.\n\nSet up an effective communications process. Explain the project plan and iterations. Describe how you review milestones and what are the payment terms and conditions. Establish accountability.\n\n### How to interview Salesforce professionals\n\nHow do you find the best Salesforce developers? Focus on interviewing the candidates effectively. We recommend the following:\n\n#### A. Look for skills in the important Salesforce solutions and Salesforce services\n\nThe landscape of Salesforce development services is vast. Even an expert Salesforce developer will not have in-depth knowledge of all the nooks and corners! Hiring Salesforce developers with deep knowledge of the entire Salesforce development space can be very hard.\n\nNarrow down your requirements appropriately. If you primarily want Salesforce CRM development skills, focus on that. Such Salesforce experts will not need experience in providing Salesforce consulting services. Maintain a laser-like focus on what you need.\n\n#### B. Follow the “80:20 rule” for skills when hiring salesforce team members\n\nYou will likely hire certified Salesforce developers. You will assess their skills in Apex, SOQL, SOSL, Visualforce, Salesforce administration, etc. These are vast skill areas. Even a certified Salesforce developer may not be proficient in every aspect of these skill areas.\n\nIn reality, you don’t need developers that are experts in every aspect of Apex, SOQL, SOSL, etc. You will use Salesforce to create business applications. The best business applications focus on simplicity. You need only 20% of the Salesforce skills 80% of the time. Look for these skills.\n\n#### C. Look for relevant experience when you hire dedicated Salesforce developers\n\nLook for relevant experience more than theoretical knowledge when hiring dedicated Salesforce developers. Programmers learn a lot more on complex projects than in training programs. Practical experience counts more than theoretical knowledge.\n\nThis is another reason why we don’t recommend hiring freelance Salesforce developers. You will find it very hard to assess the relevant experience of freelance Salesforce developers. It’s harder if you hire remote Salesforce developers.\n\nYou don’t have this challenge when hiring from a hybrid software development company like Fwork LLC. Such companies have stringent screening processes.\n\n### Examples of Salesforce coding questions\n\nWhile interviewing, focus on asking questions requiring hands-on knowledge. Review our Salesforce interview questions and answers. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### Question 1: What are the different annotations supported by Apex?\n\nAnswer: The annotations supported by Apex are as follows:\n\n*   “@AuraEnabled”;\n*   “@Deprecated”;\n*   “@Future”;\n*   “@invocableMethod”;\n*   “@IsTest”;\n*   “@ReadOnly”;\n*   “@RemoteAction”;\n*   “@TestSetup”;\n*   “@TestVisible”.\n\n#### Question 2: How should you handle bulk data in an Apex trigger?\n\nThe following best practices help to handle bulk data in an Apex trigger:\n\n*   The code in the trigger should not be constrained so that it handles one record only.\n*   Developers should use “Trigger.New” and “Trigger.Old” to get a list of records in an Apex trigger.\n*   Programmers should use “Trigger.NewMap” and “Trigger.OldMap” to get a map of the records.\n*   Salesforce developers should use only one trigger per object.\n*   One should not use SOQL queries and DML operations in an Apex trigger.\n*   Programmers should avoid a trigger recursion via a static variable when updating an object from the trigger.\n\n#### Question 3: How do you create a “many-to-many” relationship in Salesforce?\n\nAnswer: Programmers should use a “junction object” to create a many-to-many relationship in Salesforce. Junction objects are custom objects with two “Master-Detail” relationships.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWe suggest that you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. Once you have done so, a dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will contact you for a free consultation.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Heroku Developers\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHeroku is one of the world’s leading software development PaaS platforms. It first came on the scene back in June 2007, making it one of the first PaaS platforms.\n\nOriginally, Heroku only supported one programming language, Ruby, but thanks to tireless development, it now allows coding in just about any major programming language including Javascript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PHP. Python, Scala, Clojure, and Go.\n\nThis highlights the real strength of the platform, the ability to develop Heroku apps in so many different languages, and is the reason for its enormous appeal to web developers all over the world.\n\nThe first step you must undertake to hire Heroku developers is to make sure that you understand your project requirements inside and out. Draw up a clear product specification as this will help you understand the exact type of Heroku developer and the skill sets that they require.\n\nTo help you with this, here are the main skills that you require when you hire a Heroku developer:\n\n### Heroku programming skills\n\nAll mid-level to senior-level Heroku developers should have the following skills:\n\n*   Understanding and experience of using PaaS software development systems, specifically Heroku. Others such as Docker are a bonus.\n*   Heroku is polyglot, meaning that it supports most programming languages. These include Node, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Go, Scala, and Clojure. You need a developer that knows more than one of these programming languages.\n*   Understanding of coding best practices.\n*   Experience in planning, designing, and implementing cloud delivery models.\n*   Knowledge of GitHub and various continuous integration scenarios.\n*   How to automate different parts of the web development process.\n*   Understanding of database management systems such as MySQL and MongoDB.\n*   Experience with the use of HerokuAPI and with developing new APIs.\n*   A good background in some or all of the following: CSS, Redis, Vue, Bootstrap, React.js, Jquery, Django, Laravel, and AngularJS.\n*   App security including how best to secure APIs.\n*   Extensive knowledge of Heroku Buildpacks.\n\n### Other skills to look for when you hire Heroku developers\n\nNow that you have a good idea of the types of skills that you will need in your developer, let’s look at a few of the non-development-related skills that they must have.\n\n#### A. Experience\n\nThe advantages that the Heroku development platform has to offer can easily become disadvantages if your developer doesn’t have a good amount of experience in web development.\n\nIn this way, it is much like WordPress, which helps inexperienced web developers create sites that look great but would be out of reach of their abilities otherwise. For example, deploying a static HTML website on Heroku is not the sign of a developer who is experienced in web development.\n\nHeroku takes some pressure off software engineers as it allows them to focus on front-end code instead of infrastructure.\n\nWhile this is great and can help to avoid certain issues, it does mean that less knowledgeable developers are able to create good products. This won’t seem like a problem until your web application throws up some error that your less experienced developer can’t solve.\n\nExperienced front-end and back-end developers are vital as they can identify roadblocks ahead and will account for the implementation of other features later on, etc. when writing their code.\n\nAlso, more complex web applications that require some form of machine learning, etc. will require high-level developers who have experience in this niche.\n\nA thorough scrutinization of your developer’s work history is essential. Make sure that your developer also has lots of experience working in projects that were created without Heroku.\n\n#### B. App deployment on Heroku and intellectual property protection\n\nAnother advantage of Heroku is that much of the app security is handled by the platform. However, this can be a negative also. Many developers have reported issues with this. The disadvantage of this is that you are entrusting the platform with the security of your code.\n\nWhile it is relatively straightforward, your developer should have experience in deploying apps on Heroku and the best practices for the protection of your intellectual property.\n\n### How to find the best Heroku developers?\n\nThe next steps detail how to hire Heroku developers:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose the right hiring platform\n\nThe temptation of every startup or enterprise company is to try to onboard the most cost-effective developers as quickly as possible.\n\nMany startups make the mistake of heading straight to the general-purpose freelance developer sites. While such sites offer a good range of developer skill sets at low rates, they do come with big drawbacks.\n\nThey connect clients directly with freelance developers and then leave them to it. Many of these software engineers will only be able to work on your project part-time as they have other clients too.\n\nOther than the obvious distraction that comes from trying to manage a heavy workload, something which often reduces their work speed and communication skills, freelancers are unmanaged and often get charged a hefty 20% of their income by the platform.\n\nKeep in mind that if you choose to hire a developer outside of the United States or your home country, you will have to account for time zone differences when managing them.\n\nA much more sensible choice is to opt for the software developer-specific freelancer sites.\n\nThese sites offer vetted software engineers which helps you avoid getting a poor-quality programmer. Unfortunately, these developers are still freelancers so come with the obvious drawbacks. Also, these sites offer little in the way of management tools or project managers.\n\nThe best choice is to hire Heroku developers from a dedicated software development company such as Fwork LLC. Not only are our software engineers employed full-time by our platform, but their work is also guaranteed by us too.\n\nSo, if you are not 100% happy, then you don’t have to pay. We offer managed web developers and development teams. Our contract includes the option to enter into a full NDA, which is essential to protecting your idea.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nThe success of your Heroku development project depends on you finding a good coder. This you must do during the interview stage (unless you hire one from a software development company).\n\nNow it’s time to roll up the sleeves and get interviewing.\n\nIf you don’t have a good understanding of Heroku software development then you should either ask someone who does to assist or find some interview questions on Google.\n\nDuring the interview, be sure to delve into their background and experience creating Heroku apps. You should also do your research on their past projects and ask them specific questions that relate to your project specifications.\n\nKeep in mind that good communication skills are a must. In the interview, your candidate should be able to relate ideas in a clear and precise manner.\n\n#### 3\\. Get them up to speed and ready to go\n\nOnce you have found the right candidate, it is time to bring them up to speed with the project requirements, technical solutions, test plans, etc. Be sure to insist on an NDA before doing this.\n\nIntroduce your developer to your team and management processes. Make 100% sure they know what is expected of them and how to manage communications.\n\nThe final step is to get them set up with the tools that they will need to undertake your web development. Detail your project plan and work for upcoming iterations. Finalize payment conditions and get them working.\n\n### Interview tips when hiring Heroku developers\n\nWe have the following interview tips for hiring Heroku programmers:\n\n#### A. Look for skilled developers with the primary software development skills first\n\nYou should first look for software developers with the relevant primary skills. Check out their education qualification, e.g., a degree in computer science or information technology. Look for full-stack web developers or Rails developers based on your project requirements. Don’t primarily focus on Heroku skills.\n\nHeroku is an easy-to-use PaaS platform. You can get extensive and high-quality documentation. A skilled full-stack web developer or an experienced software developer can relatively easily learn Heroku.\n\nWhat if experienced Heroku developers don’t know Ruby on Rails, and you need this framework in your project? You face a steep learning curve.\n\nTherefore, focus on finding a software engineer with the relevant skills first.\n\n#### B. Evaluate the experience in using cloud computing platforms\n\nYou have clarity over the primary skills needed in your development team. You have already covered this aspect during interviews. Now you need to evaluate the experience in using cloud platforms.\n\nDo the developers have backend development experience in a cloud environment? Can they quickly work their way through a cloud platform?\n\nTop Heroku developers should have considerable experience in using cloud platforms. They should work on multiple projects using cloud platforms. They can then easily work on Heroku.\n\nAssessing this can be hard when you interview remote developers. The assessment gets harder if you interview freelancers. Hire Heroku developers from hybrid software companies like Fwork LLC. We follow a stringent screening process.\n\n#### C. Assess the software architecture skills when hiring senior software engineers\n\nIn the modern era of software engineering, software developers need a thorough understanding of architecture. We don’t expect developers to replace architects. Architects will still make the relevant architectural decisions. However, developers should know how to code in line with the relevant architectural guidelines.\n\nEvaluate the understanding of software architecture when interviewing candidates. This evaluation can be hard when interviewing remote Heroku developers, and it’s harder for freelancers.\n\nThat’s another reason to hire developers from trustworthy companies like Fwork LLC. Our vetting process does the “heavy lifting” for you.\n\n### Examples of interview questions when hiring Heroku developers\n\nAsk questions that help you to evaluate hands-on knowledge, e.g.:\n\n#### A. What are the options to install the Heroku CLI?\n\n**Answer:** You have the following options:\n\nInstalling with an installer;  \nStandalone installation with a Tarball;  \nInstalling with Ubuntu/Debian apt-get;  \nInstalling for Arch Linux;  \nInstalling with NPM.  \nHeroku doesn’t prefer the NPM option due to the lack of auto-updates.\n\n#### B. What is a “Dyno” in Heroku?\n\n**Answer:** A “Dyno” is an isolated, virtualized Unix container. A dyno in Heroku provides the environment needed to run an application.\n\n#### C. What is a “slug” in Heroku?\n\n**Answer:** A “slug” is a bundle of the source code, fetched dependencies, the language runtime, and compiled/generated output of the build system. Heroku executes slugs to run applications.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nSince you are looking for great Heroku developers, why not take a moment to complete a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. Our community of mid-level and expert full-stack developers has years of experience designing and building great apps with Heroku.\n\nOnce you have submitted your form, one of our dedicated account managers will get in touch to answer any questions that you might have."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Hadoop Developers\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHadoop, or Apache Hadoop as it is also known, was first released in 2006. This open-source collection of software utilities had gained a great reputation in the industry. Its data processing capabilities can handle massive amounts of data and large-scale computation. Since a Hadoop cluster involves commodity hardware at a low-cost, data scientists find it a very cost-effective framework.\n\nStart-ups like Cloudera made successful use of Hadoop. This led to the framework becoming very important for big data. Whether it’s data mining or using big data Hadoop in various other ways, the framework demonstrated its flexibility.\n\nThat said, some observers question the long-term prospects of Hadoop due to the growing reach of cloud computing. Many modern big data solutions have positioned themselves as an intense competition to Hadoop.\n\nHowever, its processing power and scalability mean that Hadoop remains highly relevant today. Hadoop supports a great deal of concurrency, thanks to its distributed computing model. It automatically creates a back-up of data sets, which reduces the risks from hardware failures.\n\nWhether you need insights from massive eCommerce data flow or you are working on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) project, Hadoop can deliver great value. In another example, businesses are already planning to use Hadoop in conjunction with blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of their data.\n\nCan you hire Hadoop developers easily? Not exactly. Amidst the talk of Hadoop facing stiff competition, a big data engineer with a comprehensive Hadoop skill set earns an impressive paycheck in the United States.\n\nYou need to choose the right hiring platform. Websites providing part-time freelancers can help, and some of them focus exclusively on software development. If you want full-time developers, then software development companies are a much better option.\n\nLook for the following skills when interviewing:\n\n### Primary Apache Hadoop development skills\n\nThe primary skills that a Hadoop developer needs are as follows:\n\n*   Deep knowledge of the Apache Hadoop framework;\n*   In-depth knowledge of the MapReduce programming model;\n*   Comprehensive knowledge of Apache HBase, the popular open-source non-relational database;\n*   In-depth knowledge of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), which handles the data storage part of Hadoop;\n*   Deep knowledge of Apache Kafka, the distributed streaming system that helps to integrate real-time data from several stream-producing sources;\n*   In-depth knowledge of Sqoop, the popular command-line interface (CLI) that helps to transfer data from relational databases to Hadoop and vice-versa;\n*   Excellent knowledge of SQL;\n*   Comprehensive knowledge of ETL tools and best practices;\n*   Deep knowledge of Apache Pig, a well-known platform to create programs that run on Hadoop;\n*   The experience of creating, managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting of Hadoop infrastructure;\n*   Sufficient knowledge of Apache Hive, the popular data warehouse solution that utilizes Hadoop and provides query/analysis capabilities;\n*   Deep knowledge of Linux, which includes the skills to manage its operations, networking, and security aspects.\n\n### Other skills that a Hadoop developer needs\n\nYou will need a few more skills when you hire Hadoop developers, and these are as follows:\n\n#### A. Java skills\n\nThe creators of Hadoop built it using Java. Developers that work on Hadoop need very good Java skills. This will help them to use the capabilities of Hadoop effectively. They also need good Linux skills since Hadoop was built on Linux.\n\n#### B. The knowledge of Apache Spark\n\nEffective Hadoop developers should know Apache Spark sufficiently. This cluster computing technology uses Hadoop MapReduce, however, it extends it to achieve greater efficiency. Programmers can write applications quickly using this analytics engine, and they can use it interactively from your Java, Python, R, and Scala shells.\n\n#### C. An understanding of the limitations of Hadoop\n\nWhile Hadoop is powerful, you need developers that understand its limitations. Programmers that understand this can help you to implement effective solutions based on Hadoop. They will use the strengths of Hadoop and avoid using it where it isn’t suitable.\n\nFor example, developers should understand the limitations of Hadoop in developing web apps. You can develop a web app using JavaScript or Node.js, however, Hadoop can’t be used as the backend of the web app. Hadoop isn’t a database. It offers HDFS, which is a file system that won’t allow random read and write. Experienced developers will know that they should use HBase, which runs on top of Hadoop.\n\n#### D. The knowledge of security in the context of Hadoop implementation\n\nAnother area where Hadoop has limitations is security. Developers need to implement security measures explicitly to secure the data set they will work with. This takes knowledge and experience, and this is a key reason why you should look for Hadoop developers with years of experience.\n\n#### E. The knowledge of using cloud platforms for Hadoop integration\n\nDepending on your business needs, you might choose to run Hadoop in the cloud. This is especially relevant if you don’t have the necessary on-premise computing resources to run a massive Hadoop cluster.\n\nReputed managed cloud services providers like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft can help in such cases. AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure are powerful cloud platforms with plenty of capabilities and they can help you run Hadoop on the cloud. You need Hadoop developers that are familiar with these cloud platforms.\n\n#### F. The knowledge of achieving success in a software development project\n\nFinally, you would need a few generic skills and competencies. These are as follows:\n\n*   Knowing how to develop RESTful APIs and secure them;\n*   The ability to write code that others can understand easily, which makes maintenance easier;\n*   The knowledge of computer science fundamentals;\n*   The experience of working in large distributed systems;\n*   Knowing how to manage a large volume of data effectively;\n*   The experience of reviewing code;\n*   The ability to collaborate with testers, DevOps engineers, etc.\n\n### How to find competent Hadoop developers?\n\nNow that you know the skills and competencies to look for, you need to take the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose a hiring platform to hire Hadoop developers\n\nYour choice of hiring platform impacts the future course of your project. If you hire competent people, then your project has a better chance of success.\n\nOn the other hand, developers that aren’t capable of handling complex projects can adversely impact your schedule, budget, and quality objectives. Turning around a troubled project is hard work, you need to avoid this at all costs.\n\nYou can find Hadoop developers on freelancer platforms. General-purpose freelancer platforms can connect you to freelancers, and you might be able to get a low hourly rate. However, working with freelancers involves several risks.\n\nFreelancers work part-time in your project, and managing part-time workers remotely can be challenging. Freelancer platforms deduct a considerable part of their pay, which can demotivate freelancers.\n\nReputed software development-focused freelance platforms claim to rely on a stringent screening process. This can help you to get a competent freelancer. However, you still need to mitigate the risks of working with freelancers. Freelance platforms don’t offer any project management support.\n\nSoftware development companies such as DevTeam.Sapce offer access to full-time Hadoop developers. Our transparent contracting process saves you time and effort. We cover you at every turn, including providing a replacement if the original developer gets sick, etc.\n\nIf you are not 100% happy with the quality of your code then you don’t pay until you are.\n\nFinally, we secure your sensitive data using comprehensive measures, which is another advantage. For example, our developers sign a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” (NDA). Review your business needs carefully before choosing a hiring platform.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the candidates\n\nYou have selected the hiring platform, and now it’s time to interview candidates. If you know Hadoop, then you can interview them. Otherwise, you need to take help from a knowledgeable associate or find interview questions on the Internet.\n\nCover all the skill areas that we have mentioned. Review the portfolio of the candidates and focus on the complex projects that they have worked on. Ask them how they dealt with specific complexities that relate to your project specification.\n\nDescribe the business requirements of your project and ask them how they would approach it. You should expect specific recommendations from them.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide relevant details about your Hadoop development project\n\nThe Hadoop developer you hire needs sufficient information to succeed in your project. Provide relevant documentation like business requirements, technical solutions, test plans, etc. Explain the roles and responsibilities of the developer to them.\n\nIntroduce the developer to your larger team. Provide the required access to the technical environment of your project. Show your code repository and ensure that developers get access to it.\n\nDescribe your project plan and iterations. Explain your milestone review process and payment terms and conditions. Establish a communication process.\n\n### Interview tips to hire big data Hadoop developers\n\nThe following interview tips can help you when you hire a big data Hadoop developer:\n\n#### A. Look for qualified Hadoop developers that can utilize its flexibility\n\nAn important advantage of Hadoop is its flexibility. It can process large data sets irrespective of data structures. Hadoop can process structured data, and it can process semi-structured data. You can also use it for unstructured data.\n\nSkilled developers should know how to utilize this flexibility. Look for software developers that have used Hadoop for both unstructured and structured data. Companies like Fwork LLC provides extensive Hadoop development services including these kinds of software engineers.\n\n#### B. Hire enough senior software engineers\n\nBig data development projects involving Hadoop can be complex. You need a development team with enough technical skills and experience. Look for developers with extensive knowledge of the Hadoop ecosystem. Apart from skills in programming languages like Java, look for skills in HDFS, Spark, Pig, Hive, MapReduce, HBase, and other relevant tools.\n\n#### C. Look for top Hadoop developers with experience in cloud computing\n\nThe larger shift to cloud computing is unmistakable. Most skilled developers in the Hadoop space might have good knowledge of the framework and the relevant tools. Additionally, the best Hadoop developers have considerable experience in cloud-based projects. Look for experience in using Hadoop on the cloud.\n\n#### D. Hire developers with experience in using Hadoop for numerous small files\n\nHadoop works very well for large files. It has a few limitations when accessing small files many times. Top software developers with Hadoop skills should know how to work around such limitations. Look for this experience.\n\n#### E. Look for experience in working around the processing overheads of Hadoop\n\nMost qualified Hadoop developers know how to maximize the strengths of Hadoop. They also know how to work around its processing overhead. Look for suitably experienced developers. Fwork LLC can provide you with such top Hadoop developers.\n\n### Examples of questions to ask when hiring Hadoop developers\n\nAsk questions that help you assess their practical knowledge. A few samples are as follows:\n\n#### A. What does a Hadoop “DataNode” do?\n\n**Answer:** A “DataNode” is a type of Hadoop node, i.e., a computer on the Hadoop distributed network. Such nodes store data residing on a Hadoop cluster. Hadoop replicates data on many DataNodes, which makes Hadoop reliable.\n\n#### B. What is “rack awareness” in HDFS?\n\n**Answer:** A “rack” in HDFS refers to all data nodes that form a storage area. It’s the physical location of the data stores. A NameNode in Hadoop has the rack information. This information is the rack ID of each data node. “Rack awareness” is the process to select data nodes that are nearer. This selection utilizes the rack information.\n\n#### C. What does a combiner do in the Hadoop MapReduce framework?\n\n**Answer:** A combiner is an optional class in the MapReduce framework. This class accepts the inputs from the “Map” class. It then passes the output key-value pairs to the “Reducer” class. This class summarizes the “map” output records with the same key. The “reduce” task receives that as input. The combiner class reduces the volume of data transferred between “Map” and “Reduce”.\n\nRefer to our Hadoop interview questions for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWe recommend that you fill out this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form so we can help you find the best developer for your project. Once you have, a dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will contact you. They will answer any questions that you have and explain the value that our expert Hadoop developers can offer you."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Node.js Developers\n--------------------------------------------\n\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows for the execution of JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\nA key feature of Node.js is that it utilizes a single programming language, JavaScript, for both the client-side and server-side scripts. This makes a software development project easier. You can also reduce coding errors.\n\nMany popular web apps were created using Node.js. Their creators also created the corresponding mobile apps using software from the rich JavaScript-Node.js ecosystem. Some of the popular Node.js-based platforms and apps are PayPal, Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, and Medium.\n\nBeing such a popular runtime environment means that there are lots of Node.js developers out there. The question is how do I find a great Node.js developer when there are so many?\n\nWell, the good news is that it is not as hard as it sounds when you know how. The first choice you will have to make is what kind of platform you will use.\n\nThere are several types of platforms that will enable you to hire Node.js developers.\n\nThe best option for any startup or enterprise-level company that is looking to undertake anything but the simplest project is to hire developers from a software development company such as Fwork LLC.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into the pros and cons of each type of platform, let’s take a closer look at the technical skills that you will need from your Node.js developer or development team.\n\n### Node.js programming skills\n\nThere are several key skill sets to look for in your Node.js developer:\n\n*   In-depth skills in Node.js. Node.js comes with a large library of Node.js IDEs and tools. Your developer should know about a lot of these and which ones can help your project development. A good indication of a coder who will have lots of expertise is whether or not they have contributed to the development of Node.js projects with the Node.js community.\n*   Good code writing skills and knowledge of the best practices.\n*   Experience using Node.js frameworks such as Express, Koa.js, Hapi, and Total.js.\n*   Knowledge of Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks for Node.js including Strongloop, Sinatra, and Rails.\n*   All Node.js programmers must have mastered front-end technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.\n*   A comprehensive understanding of asynchronous programming or non-blocking programming. This is still fairly new to many Node.js programmers so they need to have a total understanding of how this approach can be used most effectively.\n*   Experience developing using database management processes to integrate several different source databases into one system without significantly reducing its performance.\n*   A knowledge of RESTful APIs including the development of new ones and existing ones already available in libraries.\n\nThese are all must-have skills for any Node.js project. However, if you have a more complex project, you will need a senior-level Node.js developer.\n\n### Advanced skills in a senior-level Node.js developer\n\nThere are several other important skills any expert-level Node.js programmer should have.\n\nIf you are planning a more complex project then look for these skills:\n\n*   Experience using workflow automations such as Gulp, NPM tools such as these help to improve the speed of the finished application and so should be used.\n*   Also vital is an extensive knowledge of MVC frameworks like Meteor, Angular.js, Blaze, and React.\n*   Comprehensive knowledge of source code management tools.\n*   The skills to efficiently add scalability into web apps\n\n### Other software development skills required for Node.js web development\n\nThere are several additional skills that any Node.js software developer worth hiring should have mastered.\n\n#### A. How to best secure apps\n\nIf your final product gets a bad reputation for security, no one is going to use it. This is why you need to make certain that you hire Node.js developers who have good knowledge in this field.\n\nYour precise needs will depend on your project specifications. However, as a general rule, your Node.js developer should have good understanding and experience in the following:\n\n*   User authentication and authorization.\n*   Encryption.\n*   General application vulnerabilities and how to avoid them.\n*   How to secure APIs.\n*   Experience in undertaking security tests.\n*   An understanding of data protection laws.\n\n#### B. Error handling\n\nDealing with errors quickly and efficiently is the hallmark of any mid or senior level Node.js developer. The ability to quickly identify the cause of a problem and to solve it so that it does not reoccur should not be underestimated.\n\nA good number of entry-level Node.js programmers have not yet mastered this skill. A fairly simple error can send them into a nosedive which might take them hours or even days to solve. This is why inexperienced web developers often end up costing you more.\n\n#### C. Testing\n\nJust as efficient error handling is the sign of an experienced developer, testing is an important quality in what makes a great Node.js developer.\n\nWhile automated testing will identify many code faults very quickly. The only way to make sure that your code is as good as it should be is to get your developer to undertake regular code reviews. These are often performed at the end of each sprint in the development process.\n\nYour developer should be reviewing all the code that they have written to check for errors and identify code vulnerabilities. A good indication of their experience level will be the number of years they have been working on Node.js application development as well as any time spent working as a code reviewer. Check all these before you hire.\n\n#### D. A good track record of delivering reliable code on time\n\nThe successful collaboration between developers, testers, DevOps engineers, project managers, and the product owner is what makes effective software development possible.\n\nAll developers, no matter whether they are working in an office or remotely, must work well as part of a team. Being a reliable team player who writes good code is essential. However, the project manager also needs to know that they can rely on each member of the team to do what they are asked, as well as working well as a team.\n\nYour Node.js developer should be able to easily fit into your team. You should look for a good communicator who is able to work on their own initiative. An example of this is the ability to raise upcoming issues regarding potential roadblocks, etc., without being asked.\n\nChecking into what kinds of projects your developer has worked on will give you an idea of a programmer’s experience when it comes to working well in a team.\n\n### How to find the best Node.js developer?\n\nNow that you understand the main skill sets that you need to look out for when hiring Node.js programmers, you can begin the hiring process.\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire Node.js developers\n\nGeneral purpose freelancer sites offer clients easy access to lots of Node.js developers. They leave you in full control of the hiring and management process. You can find cost-effective developers on these platforms as they tend to charge the freelancer fees rather than the client.\n\nHowever, this is definitely a double-edged sword. Many charge substantial fees to freelancers which often demoralizes them, which is definitely not something you want.\n\nThese sites also don’t vet their freelancers, nor do they offer anything in the way of NDAs or client protection should a freelancer fail to do what they have agreed. Many freelancers only work part-time and will be in different time zones too.\n\nThere are a growing number of freelance platforms that only deal with software and UI developers. These software development-specific freelancer sites claim to vet all their applicants and to only hire the top ones.\n\nKeep in mind that you won’t get much in the way of project management or project management tools from these platforms. This means that you will need a competent PM who has experience managing remote developers. Hiring unmanaged developers can also be a problem if they are located in a far away country.\n\nThe best solution is to hire a developer or development team from a reputable software development company such as Fwork LLC.\n\nFwork LLC has vetted developers who work with the company on a full-time basis. We guarantee the quality of their work. We don’t require any payment until you are 100% happy with the work produced.\n\nWe offer managed developers as well as access to both our PM tools and our unique development process to ensure your project management is as easy as possible.\n\nWe also ensure the security of your code and sign NDAs to protect your intellectual property.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nNow you have decided on your preferred hiring method, you can start the interview process. Keep in mind that if you are using a software development company then you won’t need to spend as much time interviewing as you will with freelancer sites.\n\nStart by shortlisting the most suitable candidates and take it from there.\n\nSet up a face to face interview and come armed with plenty of good Node.js interview questions. You should also do research into the candidate’s work history and testimonials and introduce a few questions on this.\n\nAsk them questions on their knowledge and experience which are focused around the kind of tasks and work processes that your project will require.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your project\n\nOnce you have found your Node.js developer then it is time to bring them up to speed on all details of your application development project.\n\nThis will include:\n\n*   Project requirements including requirements, technical solutions, architectural decisions.\n*   Their role in the development.\n*   Your development approach i.e. Agile, Scrum, etc.\n*   Any contractual obligations including NDA.\n*   Introduction of the new developers and the larger team.\n*   Setting up communication channels and tools like GitHub.\n*   Tasks to be completed by the first milestone/sprint.\n\n### Tips for interviewing Node.js developers\n\nThe following interviewing tips could help you to hire Node.js developers:\n\n#### A. Decide early whether you will use the MEAN or MERN stacks for web app development\n\nBy choosing Node.js, you decided to use JavaScript for the entire web app development project. Therefore, developers with the knowledge of MEAN or MERN stacks could be useful.\n\nDecide whether these technology stacks fit your bill. Check whether the Node.js developers have skills in these tech stacks.\n\n#### B. Keep in mind the risk of variable type-related errors\n\nJavaScript is a dynamically typed language. It’s highly popular for developing web applications. It’s flexible, however, there’s the risk of variable type-related errors.\n\nCheck if the candidates have the skills and experience to avoid such errors. Review their completed projects. Remember that this assessment can be hard. Your best bet could be to hire from a trustworthy software company like Fwork LLC that provides Node.js application development services.\n\n#### C. Evaluate the knowledge of Node.js tools\n\nDifferent programming languages offer many open-source tools developed by their respective developer communities. JavaScript is an example. Its rich ecosystem makes web development and mobile app development easier.\n\nAlthough Node.js is a runtime environment, it’s a part of the rich JavaScript ecosystem. A vibrant developers’ community creates excellent open-source tools for Node.js. You can access them easily, thanks to Node Package Manager (NPM).\n\nThey make web app development easier. Check whether the candidates have a thorough knowledge of the important tools. Assess whether the candidates have analyzed or used some of the important tools found on the Node Package Manager.\n\nDedicated developers and dedicated teams from companies like Fwork LLC have comprehensive knowledge of these tools. That’s an advantage over other developers like freelancers.\n\n#### D. Pay attention to performance and scalability requirements\n\nSeveral programming languages offer high performance, and JavaScript is one of them. The JavaScript ecosystem has many frameworks and tools that provide performance and scalability. They help you to manage projects with stringent non-functional requirements. Node.js is an example, with its asynchronous programming capabilities.\n\nEvaluate whether the candidates know how to create performant and scalable web apps using Node.js. Check whether know about efficient API development.\n\nDedicated development teams and developers from Fwork LLC have extensive knowledge of these. That’s another reason to hire developers from us.\n\n#### E. Hire Node.js developers with a high motivation level\n\nYou certainly need skilled and experienced Node.js developers, however, you need more than that. Even the most skilled and experienced Node.js developer will deliver a below-par performance if the motivation level is low. Look for Node.js developers the demonstrate motivation and a good attitude.\n\nWhile motivation is an individual quality, the company providing you with Node.js programmers has a role to play. A few software development companies routinely encourage their Node.js programmers to upskill. Therefore, Node developers working with these companies regularly pick up new skills.\n\nE.g., they might learn other languages, databases, or other tools. Such Node.js developers have a high degree of motivation. Hire from such a Node.js development company. Fwork LLC is one such web and mobile app development company.\n\n#### F. Look for Node.js developers with a sound understanding of software architecture\n\nNode.js development isn’t just about coding. Modern web and mobile apps function in a highly competitive environment. They ought to deliver the functional requirements, however, that’s not enough.\n\nIn the long run, you need an app that you can maintain easily. You need flexibility in future API development. Your project manager needs to ensure that the app can be tested easily. The choice of software architecture pattern makes a big difference here, and architectural decisions are important.\n\nTo be sure, we are talking about hiring Node.js developers only. We are not digressing into the topic of hiring an architect.\n\nHowever, senior Node.js programmers should understand software architecture well. They will not design the architecture in a Node.js development project. Having said that, senior Node.js programmers need to implement architectural decisions effectively. They also need to provide relevant inputs to the architect. Node.js developers can do these only if they know enough about software architecture.\n\nTherefore, hire Node.js programmers with a thorough knowledge of software architecture. We at Fwork LLC have such developers, and we can help you.\n\n#### G. Hiring a remote dedicated team of Node.js developers? You need a senior team leader in that team\n\nRemote dedicated development teams have considerably helped many organizations and projects. They can work well for you too. After all, you get access to a large pool of developers.\n\nIf you want to hire Node.js developers that will work remotely for you, then you need a senior team leader in that remote team. The lack of a senior team leader will adversely impact the effectiveness of your project manager. The PM needs to spend plenty of effort just to coordinate with the remote team. Hire Node.js remote teams with a capable team leader.\n\n### Samples of questions when interviewing Node.js programmers\n\nAsk questions to assess the hands-on app development knowledge when you hire Node.js developers. Check out the following examples:\n\n#### A. Explain the function of the “EventEmitter Object” in Node.js\n\nAnswer: The asynchronous event-driven architecture of the Node.js core API has objects called “emitters”. They emit events, subsequently, functions are called. Objects that emit events are included in the “EventEmitter” class. When they emit events, the functions that are attached to that event are called asynchronously.\n\n#### B. What is an “error-first callback” in Node.js?\n\nAnswer: Node.js programmers utilize “error-first callbacks” to pass errors and data. They first pass an “error object” as a parameter to these functions. The parameters represent the data related to the object. By passing an “error object” to “error-first callbacks”, developers check for errors and handle them.\n\n#### C. What are the differences between “process.nextTick()” and “setImmediate()” functions?\n\nAnswer: The “processnextTick()” function waits for the execution of an action. It invokes the callback function after the completion of an event loop. On the other hand, the “setImmediate()” function executes a callback method on the next cycle of an event loop. It returns the control to the event loop to handle I/O operations.\n\nReview our Node.js interview questions for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nIf you are looking for expert Node.js developers, Fwork LLC is a great place to start.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Python Developers\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNearly three decades have passed since Python emerged on the scene, however, the language continues to grow in popularity. Today, its versatility and powerful features make it one of the world’s most popular languages.\n\nYou can use Python to achieve a wide range of business objectives. Developers have used it to create popular CMS products like Django CMS and Wagtail CMS, etc. System administrators, as another example, can use Python as a powerful scripting language.\n\nPython has extensive libraries that have helped developers to create excellent web frameworks. This language has important use cases on the Linux platform as well.\n\nThe language lends itself well to scientific computing. This means that you can also use it to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Big Data applications, making it a very versatile language indeed.\n\nFor many developers, Python has always been a favorite language and it remains that way today. While you might think that this means that it will be easy to find Python developers, don’t be fooled, it can take considerable effort to find and hire Python programmers with the right skills and motivation to ensure your project succeds.\n\nFirstly, you face the dilemma of choosing an appropriate hiring platform. Freelancer software development platforms may appear to be a great option, however, they come with some big risks, and we will talk about them shortly.\n\nYou should look for reputed hybrid software development companies that can provide full-time software engineers. Dedicated Python developers with several years of experience are a must. Moreover, you should look for Python programmers that can work well in a team.\n\nAnalyze your business context and project requirements so that you can choose the right hiring approach. You also need to focus on skills, which we will now cover.\n\n### Essential Python programming skills\n\n*   In-depth knowledge of the Python language.\n*   Comprehensive knowledge of popular Python frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, TurboGears, Web2py, etc.\n*   Sufficient experience with the “Object Relational Mapper” (ORM) libraries of Python.\n*   Knowledge of the strengths and limitations of Python.\n*   The understanding of how event-driven programming works in Python.\n*   Knowledge of integrating multiple databases and sources of data effectively into one application.\n*   Robust knowledge of server-side templating languages.\n*   Sufficient knowledge of front-end development technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.\n*   In-depth knowledge of relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.\n*   Good knowledge of NoSQL databases like MongoDB.\n*   The knowledge of Python Lambda functions.\n*   The ability to create database schemas in line with the business requirements.\n\nThe programmers you hire need to know the web framework that you plan to use.\n\nAs stated before, Python offers powerful libraries, which is one of its key advantages. Your business requirements will determine which libraries are important in your project. For example, if you are undertaking a machine learning software development project, then the following Python libraries will be useful:\n\n*   TensorFlow;\n*   Scikit-Learn;\n*   Numpy;\n*   Keras;\n*   PyTorch;\n*   LightGBM;\n*   Eli5;\n*   SciPy;\n*   Theano;\n*   Pandas.\n\nDevelopers should have the know-how in the Python libraries that are important to your project.\n\n_Note: If you have customized requirements, then you need to look for the skills related to this as well. For example, you would need to look for native Android and iOS development expertise if you plan to launch mobile applications._\n\n### Other software development skills required for Python development\n\nYou need a Python expert with well-rounded software development skills. Some of these skills may not exclusively be linked to Python programming, however, they carry a lot of importance. These are as follows:\n\n#### A. The knowledge of coding scalable applications\n\nLook for a web developer with Python skills that knows how to develop scalable applications. This requires the following:\n\n*   Understanding the scalability requirements of a project and focusing on the right metrics.\n*   Robust knowledge of databases and frameworks since they impact how an application scales.\n*   The knowledge of coding performant apps that will work well across various platforms.\n*   The knowledge of best practices that aid in developing scalable applications.\n\n#### B. The knowledge and experience to secure web applications\n\nYou will rarely develop applications that only deal with aggregate and anonymized information. Some applications might deal with only aggregate Google Analytics or other social media data without any sensitive information. In most cases, you will develop applications that feature more complexities and process sensitive personal information.\n\nYou need to secure your Python application, and you need software programmers that know how to code secure applications.\n\nYou need software engineers that know the following:\n\n*   How to identify and mitigate key application security vulnerabilities like injection, insufficient security configuration, etc.\n*   How to use tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication, encryption, etc.\n*   How to secure 1st party APIs that you might develop.\n\n#### C. The knowledge of working with cloud platforms\n\nCloud computing has enabled organizations to innovate rapidly since it allows them to focus on development. Managed cloud services providers eliminate the time and effort spent on infrastructure management.\n\nYou will likely use a “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platform in this project.\n\nReputed PaaS platforms like Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk take care of several aspects such as servers, operating system, and runtime environment. This enables you to concentrate on development. Look for Python programmers that are familiar with well-known PaaS platforms.\n\n#### D. The knowledge to develop 1st party APIs\n\nYou might develop your own APIs so that the front-end of your app can get a consistent framework to access the back-end. Look to hire Python experts with experience developing APIs. Developers need to know the following:\n\n*   How to use prominent API development and documentation tools.\n*   How to host APIs using the cloud computing platform.\n*   Using databases to develop the backend.\n*   How to create effective rules for API requests and responses.\n*   How to secure APIs using techniques like authentication token, encryption, etc.\n*   Designing API endpoint URLs smartly.\n\n#### E. The competencies, skills, and necessary experience required for a software development project\n\nWhile programming language and database skills are very important, effective developers need more than that. Competent Python developers need the following capabilities:\n\n*   Collaboration: A software developer needs to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers. This is crucial for building an effective CI/CD environment, moreover, this helps in security/compliance testing.\n*   The knowledge of software architecture: Python experts don’t need to be software architects. However, they need to know how to align their code with the architecture decisions made in the project. This helps while developing web services.\n*   The familiarity with UI design principles: A software engineer with Python skills doesn’t need to be a UI designer. However, they need to know how to code in line with the UI design principles used in the project.\n*   Code review: Experienced developers can review code, and this makes a big difference. Code review can detect bugs earlier. It plays a key part in unearthing certain types of bugs like security vulnerabilities.\n\n### How to find the best Python developers?\n\nNow that you know the required skills, you can turn to the hiring process. Take the following steps to hire Python developers:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire Python developers\n\nYour choice of the hiring platform will have a significant impact on your project.\n\nThe wrong choice can result in you hiring incompetent Python developers, which could put your project schedule, budget, and quality objectives at risk. It takes a lot of work to turn troubled projects around, therefore, think carefully before choosing a hiring platform.\n\nYou can hire through a general-purpose freelancer site and hire Python developers via their transparent contracting process. While this could help you to find a programmer at a low hourly rate, this approach comes with big risks.\n\nFreelancers mostly work remotely and they might only work part-time on your project. They also have up to 20% of their earnings deducted by the platform, You also might find it hard to manage the work of a freelancer in India while you are based in the United States, for example.\n\nThe alternative is freelancer sites that focus on software development. Such sites can provide you with experienced Python programmers. The screening process of this platform ensures that only top developers can join this community.\n\nYou can get high-quality Python developers with these platforms. However, these platforms don’t provide any management support though and you need to mitigate all risks concerning working with freelance programmers.\n\nThe best option is to hire developers or dev teams through hybrid software development companies such as Fwork LLC.\n\nOur community of full-time vetted developers is on hand to help with any kind of project that you might have. We guarantee the quality of work produced by all of our developers so you don’t need to worry. We offer NDAs to give you the peace of mind that all your intellectual property is protected.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates to find top Python developers\n\nAfter you choose your hiring platform, you need to interview the shortlisted candidates. You can interview them yourself if you are a Python expert.\n\nIf you aren’t an expert, then you can get interview questions from Stack Overflow or similar sources on the Internet. If you have an associate with expertise in Python, you can ask them to interview the shortlisted candidates.\n\nYou need to cover all the technical skills that we have mentioned. Find out about their experience with common source code management tools like Git.\n\nPay attention to the project experience of the candidates, and ask them to show you apps that they have developed. Check whether they have the experience of working on complex Python projects. Pick complex projects from their portfolio and ask them how they approached various complex problems in those projects.\n\nExplain the business requirements of your project. Ask them for specific suggestions on how they would approach your project. Shortlisted candidates should provide specific responses and high-level statements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide all relevant information about your app development project\n\nYou need to provide all the key information about your project so that the new developers can succeed. Start with the project documentation such as business requirements, technical solutions, architectural decisions, test plans, etc. Explain your project in detail.\n\nIntroduce the developers to your larger team. It’s especially important to introduce them to the people they will work closely with, e.g., testers, UI designers, and DevOps engineers. Establish a communication process. Give access to the technical environment of your project. You will need to point them to the code repository of your project and other such tools.\n\nExplain the project plan and schedule to the developers. Provide details related to the iterations and explain your milestone review process. Explain the payment T&Cs and establish accountability measures.\n\n### How to interview Python programmers\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for hiring Python developers:\n\n#### A. Tailor the interview to your project\n\nWhy do you want to hire a Python developer? Take a look at other open Python developer positions and isolate exactly why you need them.\n\nDo you need software developers for scripting? Is your Python project for web development, and do you need a full-stack developer? Do you need skilled Python developers for machine learning (ML) development?\n\nPython is an incredibly versatile language. You can do a lot with it. However, even the most talented Python developers might not be experts in ML development, data science, web development, and scripting simultaneously!\n\nMake sure that your requirements are specific. Interview Python developers with the relevant experience.\n\nThis is why we don’t recommend hiring freelance Python developers. You might think that you are interviewing the top freelance Python developers, however, it’s hard to assess their relevant experience. You will find it harder in the case of remote Python developers.\n\n#### B. Assess the ability to code bug-free programs\n\nJudge the ability of the candidate to code error-free Python programs. Python is a dynamically typed language. That offers flexibility. However, some developers inadvertently introduce type-related bugs. You need developers that know how to avoid this.\n\n#### C. Assess the knowledge of Python libraries\n\nYou should check if the candidate has sufficient knowledge of Python libraries. Python has excellent libraries that offer productivity. Many AI/ML and data science project teams use Python due to the extensive libraries. Qualified Python developers should have a thorough knowledge of Python libraries.\n\n### Examples of Python programming language coding questions\n\nAsk questions that help you to gauge the hands-on knowledge of the Python developers. The following are a few examples:\n\n#### Question 1: How to reverse a list in Python?\n\nAnswer: Programmers can use the Python method called “reverse()” to reverse a list. The following is an example:\n\n    def reverse(s);\n    str = “”\n    for i in s:\n    str = i + str\n    return str\n    \n\n#### Question 2: How can you convert an integer to a string in Python?\n\nAnswer: Python developers can use the built-in “str()” function to convert integers to strings. Programmers can use it to convert any Python data type to a string. The following example shows how it works:\n\n    num = 10\n    converted_num = str(num)\n    \n\n#### Question 3: What are the distinct characteristics of the “Lambda function” in Python?\n\nAnswer: The “Lambda” function in Python is an anonymous function. Programmers can use many parameters with it, however, they can have only one statement. The following example shows how the “Lambda” function in Python works:\n\n    a = m,n : m+n\n    print(a(10, 11))\n    \n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nPython lets you do a lot thanks to its powerful features and excellent libraries. Having said that, Python development projects can be complex. You should look to hire Python developers with years of experience in complex projects so that you ensure they have all the skills your project needs to succeed.\n\nWhy not take a few minutes and fill out this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire PHP Developers\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe 1st release of PHP was way back in 1995. That’s quite some time ago when it comes to the software development industry. However, in this time, many developers and organizations have done great things with it. Magento, the popular eCommerce platform uses PHP as its underlying technology. CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla use PHP as their foundation too.\n\nBy its very design, PHP makes it easy to accomplish a number of web development tasks. For example, developers have built PHP scripts that allow you to easily put a Skype live chat box on your website.\n\nMany developers know PHP, so you might think that hiring PHP developers is easy. Indeed, you can find PHP developers on the freelancer platforms, and lots of them too. However, the hiring process can be quite problematic for a number of reasons.\n\nTo negate these problems, you need to analyze your project requirements carefully. This will help you to choose the right hiring models. We will get to this later.\n\nLet’s start by looking at how you can evaluate, shortlist and interview your PHP programmers for hire. We suggest that you look for the following skills:\n\n### Essential PHP programming skills\n\nWhen you interview PHP developers, you should look for the following:\n\n*   The programmer should have in-depth skills in PHP. While this programming language has many strengths, it also has certain limitations. You need PHP developers that know how to use the strengths of PHP to your advantage while managing the limitations.\n*   You might have planned to use one of the popular PHP frameworks in your project. Laravel, Codeigniter, Symfony, and CakePHP are a few examples. You need PHP programmers that have several years of experience in your choice of framework.\n*   Successful PHP programmers should have experience with front-end technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This is especially important in website development projects.\n*   You need PHP developers that have in-depth knowledge in modern SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. You should also look for experience in popular NoSQL databases like MongoDB.\n*   You should look for PHP developers that know how to create database schemas.\n*   Effective PHP developers know how to integrate various data sources and databases into one application system.\n\n### Other skills that are important to developing web applications using PHP\n\nYou should look for a few more skills, however, these aren’t necessarily tied to PHP. These are as follows:\n\n*   A good understanding of the “Model-View-Controller” (MVC) design patterns;\n*   Object-oriented programming skills;\n*   Server-side development skills;\n*   The familiarity with common source code management tools;\n*   The skills to develop scalable web apps.\n\n_Note: Depending on the features you offer in your web app, you could also use other modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Analytics, etc. You need to evaluate such skills separately, e.g., Python for AI development. In this guide, we focus on skills primarily needed for web development using PHP._\n\n### Other software development skills required for PHP web development\n\nTo ensure a successful final product, you need PHP developers that have some other skills too. These are as follows:\n\n#### A. The skills to secure web applications\n\nMost web apps process some amount of sensitive data. These will vary from application to application. An eCommerce application will process payment data, whereas an online learning web app will process user credentials, etc.\n\nNo matter what kind of sensitive information you process in your app, you need to secure it. Data security and privacy have emerged as a key focus area for almost all businesses, and governments have stepped up to ensure it is protected. Depending on the industry you serve, you might need to comply with stringent regulations concerning data security and privacy.\n\nYou need PHP developers that know how to code secure apps. Consider the following:\n\n*   The knowledge of key application security risks and how to mitigate them;\n*   The knowledge of tools and technologies like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption;\n*   The maturity to understand the importance of compliance and security testing, which makes developers collaborate proactively with security and compliance testers;\n*   The knowledge of securing 1st party APIs that you might develop.\n\n#### B. The knowledge to develop 1st party APIs\n\nAPIs have made a big difference to modern software development since they allow the front-end of an application to access the backend using a consistent framework. You can scale up your software development process using APIs.\n\nFor a few non-core features, you can use leading 3rd party APIs. However, using too many 3rd party APIs can cause many dependencies. We always recommend that you develop 1st party APIs for your core features.\n\nThe de-facto standard for API development is REST (Representational State Transfer). We recommend you develop RESTful APIs when developing PHP web applications. You should look for the following skills:\n\n*   Developers should know how to host APIs using cloud platforms.\n*   They should know how to use modern databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to build the backend.\n*   Programmers should know how to use relevant tools for API development and documentation.\n*   You need developers to know how to create API endpoint URLs intelligently. They should also be able to create effective rules for API requests and responses.\n*   Programmers should know how to secure APIs. They need to use various tools and techniques like authentication token, encryption, quotas, throttling, and secure gateways for this.\n\n#### C. The knowledge of working with cloud platforms\n\nYou could use cloud platforms to expedite your project. For web application development, “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platforms can help.\n\nReputed PaaS platforms manage the cloud infrastructure, networking, storage, operating system, middleware, and runtime environment. You can focus on development instead of infrastructure management.\n\nYou can use the DevOps tools and auto-scaling solutions offered by the PaaS platform. PaaS platforms also help you to integrate APIs. Look for coders that know how to work on reputed PaaS platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n#### D. The knowledge and experience of successfully delivering software development projects\n\nDelivering software development projects successfully requires more than technical skills. You should look for the following:\n\n*   PHP programmers should have lots of experience in reviewing code. While testing is important, it can’t unearth all defects. Code review is crucial to detect some types of defects, and application security vulnerabilities are prime examples of this. Code review can also detect defects early in the cycle. You should look for experienced PHP programmers since they typically have code review experience.\n*   Successful programmers know how to code in line with the UI design. They know how to implement the intricacies of a great UI design in their code.\n*   While software architects choose the architecture pattern, effective programmers should know how to code in alignment with the architectural decisions.\n*   Great PHP programmers know how to work in a team. Take the example of establishing a CI/CD environment. Effective collaboration between developers, testers, and DevOps engineers carry as much importance for this as DevOps tools. Look for the ability to collaborate.\n\n### How to find the best PHP developer?\n\nYou now know the skills to look for when hiring PHP programmers. It’s time to start the hiring process, which involves the following:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose freelancer platforms or a development company?\n\nChoosing the right hiring platform is an important factor. Hiring incompetent people from the wrong platform can derail the project. Turning a troubled project around requires lots of hard work and money.\n\nThink through your project requirements carefully. This can help you to choose the right hiring platform. General-purpose freelancer sites make it easy to hire PHP web developers. You can interview the candidate directly. Unfortunately, it requires lots of time to vet them.\n\nAlso, remember that freelancers won’t work full-time on your project. Managing the project schedule can be hard if you have part-time developers.\n\nThese platforms don’t offer any management oversight. If you are in the USA and managing a freelancer from India, for example, then time differences and general management processes become important! A great tip is to hire only in regions that have at least sereral hours of time overlap.\n\nSoftware development-focused freelancer sites have stringent screening processes. They allow only the top developers into their communities, therefore, they will likely provide you with experienced PHP developers with robust skills. The downside is that they don’t provide any management oversight, and you need to mitigate the risks of working with freelancers.\n\nHybrid software development companies such as Fwork LLC allow you to hire dedicated PHP developers from their vetted communities. We offer a transparent and simple contracting process, which is aimed to help save time. All of our developers are experts in their field and have industry experience too.\n\nWe implement physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to secure your sensitive data. We get our developers to sign a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” (NDA). This proactive approach to data security is a big advantage.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nNow that you have decided on the right hiring platform, assuming that you have not hired from a hybrid software company, which will do all the leg work for you, you will need to start the interview process. If you are a PHP expert, then you should be able to interview the shortlisted candidates.\n\nIf you aren’t an expert, then we suggest that you get interview questions from the Internet. You can also ask a friend, an associate, or hire a PHP consultant with PHP expertise to conduct the interviews.\n\nEnsure that you cover the skills we have highlighted. Take the time to investigate each candidates past PHP project experience.\n\nRemember that projects like eCommerce development are relatively easy, therefore, look for more complex PHP projects in their portfolio. Review the testimonials in their portfolio. Don’t make the mistake of basing your decision on them alone.\n\nAsk how they dealt with complexities and what kind of development processes they have used. Check their knowledge of coding best practices and find out how they go about debugging complex errors. Focus on application security and find out how they would mitigate key security vulnerabilities like injection, broken authentication, etc.\n\nExplain your project requirements to the shortlisted candidates. Ask for their view on the project and how they would go about it. Don’t satisfy yourself with general high-level responses, delve deeper and ask for specific points about how they would approach your project.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your application development project\n\nThe PHP developers you select need sufficient information to succeed in your project. Explain the project background to them and provide detailed documentation like requirements, technical solutions, architectural decisions, etc.\n\nThey will need to work closely with the rest of your team so introduce them to your team so they can get to know each other. Establish a communication process. The developers you select need access to the technical environment of your project, therefore, grant them the relevant access. Show them your code repositories in GitHub.\n\nYou need to establish accountability. Give a detailed overview of the roles and responsibilities. Explain your project plan including sprints. Describe the various milestones and acceptance criteria. Describe the review process and how you will approve milestones. You are now ready to start.\n\n### Interview tips for you when you hire PHP programmers\n\nKeep the following interview tips in mind when you look for PHP programmers:\n\n#### A. Assess the performance tuning experience\n\nAs a server-side scripting language, PHP offers a lot. However, it’s not a compiled language. It’s not as fast as the popular compiled programming languages. PHP development teams need to proactively work towards closing the performance gaps.\n\nLook for software developers with experience in performance tuning in PHP projects. This will especially pay off in PHP web development projects.\n\n#### B. Evaluate the relevant PHP development experience\n\nYou need a laser-like focus on relevant experience. Don’t think that the best PHP developers are the ones with the best theoretical knowledge.\n\nPHP is a programming language with many features. Even the top PHP developers might not know all of the features fully. They don’t really need to know all of the features!\n\nA successful PHP project focuses on simplicity. Successful teams work with the 80:20 rule. They meet 80% of the project requirements with 20% of the programming language capabilities.\n\nThis is why you should focus on the relevant project experience over theoretical knowledge. That’s also why we recommend you hire programmers from trustworthy PHP web development companies. Companies like Fwork LLC offer highly credible PHP development services. You can easily assess the relevant experience of developers.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s hard to assess the relevant experience of freelance PHP developers. Freelance PHP developers might show a comprehensive project portfolio. You might think that you found highly competent freelance PHP developers. However, you can’t easily assess their project experience.\n\nIt’s harder if you hire remote PHP developers that are freelancers. After all, you don’t meet remote PHP developers face-to-face! That’s why it makes sense to hire from companies like Fwork LLC.\n\n#### C. Focus on skills in libraries and built-in modules\n\nYou want your team to be productive. Therefore, you should have developers that know how to use PHP to their advantage.\n\nPHP provides excellent library support. This helps you with data representation. The language also has built-in database connection modules. They help you to connect with databases. Look for programmers with a thorough knowledge of libraries and built-in modules.\n\n### Examples of coding questions to ask when you hire a PHP developer\n\nAsk PHP programming language questions that test the hands-on knowledge of candidates. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### A. Show a few examples of comparison operators in PHP.\n\nAnswer: You can use the PHP comparison operators to compare two different values. The following are a few examples:\n\n*   “Equal”: This operator checks if two values are equal after type juggling. The syntax is “$a == $b”.\n*   “Identical”: You can compare if two values of the same type are equal using this operator. Its syntax is “$a === $b”.\n*   “Less than”: With this operator, you can check if one value is less than the other. The syntax is “$a < $b”.\n\n#### B. How can you loop through each key/value pair in a PHP array?\n\nAnswer: PHP programmers can use the “PHP foreach loop” for this. The syntax is as follows:\n\n    foreach ($array as $value) {\n    //write the code block that should be executed here\n    }\n\nPHP assigns the value of the current array element to “$value”. Subsequently, it moves the array pointer by 1. PHP continues this process for each loop iteration until the last element.\n\n#### C. How do you calculate the total number of days between two dates in PHP?\n\nAnswer: Use the following code to calculate the total number of days between two dates:\n\n    <?php\n    $dateX = \"2022-02-01\"; # date X\n    $dateY = \"2022-02-05\"; # date Y\n    \n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nPHP is a powerful and versatile language. While it allows you to do a lot, remember that software development using PHP can get complex. You need programmers that know how to navigate such complexities.\n\nWhy not take a few minutes and fill out this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form?

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Java Developers\n-----------------------------------------\n\nJava emerged back in 1995, meaning it is now a well-known and established language. Two-and-a-half decades later, it has built an army of software developers who can write with it.\n\nThis general-purpose programming language is class-based and object-oriented. Organizations of all sizes use this open-source programming language for a wide range of projects. They use it to develop desktop and mobile apps. Many businesses use it for web development, big data processing, embedded systems development, etc.\n\nThe “write once, run anywhere” (WORA) philosophy of Java allows for great portability. This statically-typed language with powerful memory management features enables coders to avoid many common programming errors.\n\nOracle claims that Java runs on 3 billion devices, and that’s not surprising. The language covers a wide spectrum of the software development landscape. Whether native Android development or using J2EE in an enterprise project, Java has made its mark.\n\nMany observers compare Java with languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, etc. These other languages certainly have their strengths. However, Java remains the first choice whenever most organizations undertake a complex software development project.\n\nIts versatility drives start-ups and technology giants alike to use Java. For example, Google uses Java in many of its most important projects.\n\nThe popularity of Java has resulted in many developers learning it. Therefore, you might think that you can easily hire Java developers. However, the demand for Java programmers is great too. As a recruiter, you might need to spend significant time and effort to hire them.\n\nYou need to choose which hiring platform to use. General-purpose freelancer platforms can help you to find Java developers.\n\nThe best option, however, is to choose a reputed software development company that can help you to hire full-time Java developers. If you are executing a complex app development project, then you will need full-time programmers. Software development companies might be more useful in this case.\n\nYou will need to interview Java programmers. We suggest that you look for the following skills:\n\n### Java development skills\n\nTop Java developers should know the following:\n\n*   Java programming language and its rich ecosystem;\n*   Various software architectural patterns;\n*   Object-oriented programming;\n*   How to write reusable Java libraries;\n*   The working of “Model-View-Controller” (MVC) pattern;\n*   How JDBC works;\n*   Popular frameworks to develop web applications, e.g. Spring Boot, Struts, Play, and Spark;\n*   How concurrency works in Java;\n*   Hibernate, the popular “Object-Relational Mapping” (ORM) tool for Java programming;\n*   How to add Java code in HTML by using JSP;\n*   Java GUI frameworks like Swing;\n*   How Java servlets work;\n*   How the “Java Virtual Machine” (JVM) works and what are its limitations;\n\nDepending on your project requirements, you need to look for more specific skills. For example:\n\n*   You might need skills in specific web development framework;\n*   You could need full-stack web developers with CSS and HTML skills along with Java skills;\n*   You need developers that know popular IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA;\n*   For developing a native Android app, you need coders with native Android development experience and familiarity with Android Studio.\n\n### Other skills that Java developers need\n\nBest Java developers need a few more skills, which are as follows:\n\n#### A. The knowledge of DevOps tools and practices\n\nJava developers in the modern era of software development need to understand DevOps tools and practices very well. The tools could vary depending on projects, however, the underlying DevOps concepts are the same. You need Java programmers that know the importance of an effective CI/CD environment.\n\n#### B. Familiarity with cloud platforms\n\nYou will likely use a cloud platform in your project. Cloud platforms eliminate the need for upfront investment in infrastructure, moreover, you don’t need to focus on infrastructure management.\n\nYour project requirements will determine the cloud platform you use. For example, you will use “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platforms AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku to develop web applications. On the other hand, you will use a “Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service” (MBaaS) platform like AWS Amplify for developing mobile applications. You need a software developer with Java skills that also knows how to use these platforms.\n\n#### C. The knowledge of developing secure applications\n\nYou might process sensitive information in your app and not just aggregate social media data. You need Java developers that know how to code secure applications. Look for the following skills:\n\n*   How to proactively identify and mitigate key application security vulnerabilities like injection and broken authentication;\n*   The knowledge of using tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, etc.;\n*   How to secure APIs.\n\n#### D. The skills to develop 1st party APIs\n\nYou will likely develop 1st party APIs since they help the front-end of your application to access the back-end using a consistent framework. REST (Representational State Transfer) is the de-facto standard for API development, therefore, you need Java developers that know how to develop RESTful APIs.\n\nLook for programmers that know how to use API development and documentation tools. They should know how to host APIs using cloud platforms. They need the skills to build the backend by using modern SQL and NoSQL databases.\n\nJava programmers should know how to create effective rules for API requests and responses. They need to secure APIs using tools and techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, quotas, throttling, and secure gateways.\n\n#### E. A background of succeeding in software development projects\n\nThe Java developers you hire should know how to succeed in a software development project. They need to know the following:\n\n*   How to code in line with the architectural decisions in the project and why it’s important for developing web services;\n*   Coding in alignment with the user interface design principles used in the project;\n*   How to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers to establish an effective CI/CD platform;\n*   How to review code and find defects early in the lifecycle;\n*   The importance of collaborating with the information security team for compliance and security testing.\n\n### How to find competent Java developers?\n\nWe have covered the skill requirements, therefore, let’s take the subsequent steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Choose a hiring platform to hire Java developers\n\nYour choice of the hiring platform influences your project a great deal. Hiring the right kind of people will help ensure project success. On the other hand, hiring inexperienced Java programmers can cause significant deviations from your budget, schedule, and quality objectives.\n\nTurning a troubled project around costs a lot. Choose your hiring platform carefully.\n\nGeneral-purpose freelancer sites can help you to hire Java developers. Their transparent and secure contracting processes can help. While you can get freelancers at a lower rate, you expose yourself to risks.\n\nFreelancers work part-time on your project. They work remotely, and managing part-time remote freelancers can be hard. Freelancer platforms deduct up to 20% of their earnings, which can demotivate them.\n\nFreelancer platforms specializing in software development are a better option. Their screening process ensures that only high-quality developers join their community. They don’t offer any project management support though. You will need to mitigate the risks of working with freelancers without support from the platform. Be 100% sure to sign an NDA.\n\nThe best option is to hire Java developers from software development companies such as Fwork LLC. In addition to providing development services, we provide full-time developers who are experts in whatever tech stacks your project requires. You can onboard and offboard the developer whenever you like.\n\nWe also implement physical, technical, and procedural safeguards such as NDAs to secure your sensitive information.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nYou have now chosen a hiring platform, now you need to interview the candidates. If you are a Java expert, then you can now interview them. Otherwise, you can ask an associate to interview the candidates. You can also find interview questions from websites like Stack Overflow, etc.\n\nCover all the skill areas that we have mentioned. Ask the candidates about the complex projects in their portfolio. Find out from them how they approached the complex problems thrown up during the development.\n\nExplain your project requirements, and ask them how they would approach them. You should expect specific responses.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide relevant information about your application development project\n\nEven top Java developers need relevant information to succeed in your project. Explain the business requirements and the architectural decisions, and provide the documents to the developer you hire. Introduce the developer to your team.\n\nExplain the roles and responsibilities of the developer. Provide access to the technical environment of your project including your source code repository. Set up a communication process. Explain the project schedule and iterations. Describe your milestone review process and payment T&Cs.\n\n### Interview tips for hiring Java developers\n\nKeep the following interview tips in mind when you hire a Java software engineer or development team:\n\n#### A. Prioritize productivity when looking for Java developer talents\n\nJava is one of the most popular programming languages. There’s a large and vibrant community of Java developers. Many software engineers have created excellent tools and frameworks for Java. You can gain considerable productivity by using them, however, you need developers with in-depth knowledge of the important tools.\n\nFinding such top Java developer talent can be hard. It’s harder if you interview remote Java developers. You will find it even harder to hire such quality freelance Java developers.\n\nYou can outsource Java development to companies like Fwork LLC. We provide trustworthy and quality Java development services.\n\nYou can also hire dedicated Java developers from us. Our vetting process ensures that your future Java developers are skilled, experienced, and motivated.\n\n#### B. Focus on the knowledge of multi-threading when looking for qualified Java developers\n\nJava supports multithreading, which is a key advantage. You need the right developers to use this capability though.\n\nFreelance Java developers might not have the requisite experience. A freelance Java developer might show a large project portfolio. However, how do you verify the tall claims?\n\nCompanies like Fwork LLC does the “heavy lifting” for you while screening developers. You get software engineers with the required skills and experience.\n\n#### C. Hire enough senior Java developers\n\nJava is a simple language. However, Java programming requires enough care and diligence in complex projects.\n\nYou should have a team with a judicious mix of senior, mid-level, and junior developers. Don’t plan to hire only junior developers. Such a team might not be able to meet the schedule, budget, and quality objectives of your project. These challenges will be compounded if you hire freelance Java programmers.\n\n#### D. Focus on the important frameworks and libraries when looking for great Java developers\n\nThe Java ecosystem is vast. Focus on the libraries, frameworks, and tools that you need. Even the most experienced Java developers don’t know all frameworks, libraries, and tools in the Java ecosystem. Hire a Java developer that has the skills that you need.\n\n### Examples of interview questions when you hire a Java developer\n\nExperienced Java developers should have the requisite hands-on skills. To hire skilled developers, ask questions to assess their practical knowledge. The following are a few examples:\n\n#### A. How do path and classpath variables differ in Java?\n\n**Answer:** The operating system uses the path variable to find the executables. On the other hand, Java uses the classpath variable to find class files.\n\n#### B. Mention the differences between vectors and arrays in Java.\n\n**Answer:** Vectors are dynamically allocated. They have dynamic lists of references to other objects. Vectors can hold data of different types, and their size can change. Arrays are static. They have fixed primitive types and sizes.\n\n#### C. Explain the need for the finalize() method.\n\n**Answer:** The Java garbage collector calls the finalize() method when it finds that there are no references to an object. Such objects can then be discarded. Java uses the finalize() method for such clean-up tasks.\n\nRefer to our Java interview questions for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWe recommend that you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. A dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will contact you to answer any questions you might have.\n\nOur account manager can also introduce you to our expert Java developers and explain how our unique process can help you."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire R Language Developers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nR emerged in 1993. Despite all the years that have passed, it remains very popular.\n\nIn addition to being an open-source programming language, R also offers an integrated suite of software suitable for data manipulation, calculations, and graphical display. If you are a data scientist or statistician, then R is probably a familiar favorite already. You can also build interactive web apps with the help of Shiny, a popular R package.\n\nYou can use R for a wide range of solutions. The language lends itself well to various purposes like machine learning, data analysis, data science, data visualization, big data, statistical computing, data mining, econometrics, statistical analysis, and deep learning.\n\nThe TIOBE index consistently cites the popularity of R, moreover, the Stack Overflow developer surveys do too. Google utilizes R heavily in its large-scale data analytics and machine learning projects.\n\nIn the data science area, Scala has acquired a great reputation too. However, R delivers excellent performance in several areas and commands a greater following. Take the example of data visualization using Excel spreadsheets. You can use RStudio, a popular IDE for R. The user-friendliness of RStudio and the power of R can help you to achieve excellent analytics. If you are a data analyst, you can now shelve that spreadsheet.\n\nWhile more and more developers are taking an interest in this language, the demand for these developers is growing too. Keep in mind that R has a steeper learning curve than other analytics-focused languages such as SAS. Therefore, you might find it hard to hire a competent R developer.\n\nYou will need to begin by choosing a hiring platform. We will touch upon this shortly.\n\nAfter you decide on the hiring platform, you need to interview the candidates. We suggest that you look for the following skill sets:\n\n### R programming skills\n\nYou need developers with the following skills:\n\n*   In-depth skills and experience in R;\n*   Sufficient knowledge in at least one of the following languages: Python, C++, Java, Perl, and Ruby;\n*   Adequate knowledge in computer science.\n\nThe above are fundamental skills requirements. Your project will likely involve several other aspects like ETL, creating a web app, etc. Therefore, successful R programmers should also know the following:\n\n*   RStudio, the well-known IDE for R;\n*   Well-known R machine learning packages like CARET;\n*   Popular ETL tools like Apache Spark or Panoply for data processing;\n*   How to integrate R with other popular web development languages like PHP;\n*   Popular packages like OpenNLP that help with NLP and text mining;\n*   How to use R for machine learning development;\n*   How to use robust databases like Oracle for R programming;\n*   Using R in popular software like Tableau;\n*   How to create time series analysis using R;\n*   Using R with Hadoop for big data analytics;\n*   How to use R Shiny, the popular package to build interactive web apps;\n*   Using the data mining capabilities of R in projects like social media data analysis;\n*   How to use prominent R big data packages;\n*   How to use the data visualization capabilities of R.\n\nIf you have unique requirements that specific R packages can serve, then you need to look for those skills too.\n\n_Note: Despite its strengths, R does have a few limitations. For example, this programming language has limitations concerning data management. To be an effective R programmer, one needs to know how to manage such limitations. To take yet another example, R offers a limited number of algorithms for decision trees. An effective R developer needs a good understanding of premium tools like SPSS that provide comprehensive decision-tree algorithms. This understanding will help them to get ideas to circumvent the algorithm-related limitations of R._\n\n### Other software development skills required for R development\n\nAn application developer working on the R language needs more skills, which are as follows:\n\n#### A. The skills to code scalable applications\n\nDevelopers need to understand scalability requirements and which performance metrics are most important to meet them. They should know which development frameworks and database solutions help one to create scalable applications. Programmers also need to know the best practices that enable them to develop scalable apps.\n\n#### B. The knowledge and experience to secure applications\n\nYou will most likely process some form of sensitive information in your application. Given the focus on information security, users demand apps that protect sensitive data. Governments and regulators have come up with stringent data security and privacy regulations too.\n\nYou need programmers that know the following:\n\n*   How to proactively identify and mitigate key application security vulnerabilities;\n*   Using techniques and tools like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, etc. to secure applications;\n*   The importance of collaborating with testers and DevOps engineers to ensure security testing early enough in the life cycle.\n\n#### C. The skills to develop 1st party APIs\n\nAPIs provide a consistent framework for the front-end of your app to access the back-end, therefore, you will likely want to create your own APIs. You need programmers that can develop RESTful APIs. They need to know the following:\n\n*   How to use API development and documentation tools;\n*   How to use cloud platforms to host APIs;\n*   Using modern database solutions to build the back-end;\n*   How to create effective rules for API requests and responses;\n*   How to design API endpoint URLs smartly;\n*   Using techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, etc. to secure APIs.\n\n#### D. Knowing how to succeed in a software development project\n\nYou need developers with the competencies, skills, and experience to achieve success in software development. The R programmer you hire should know the following:\n\n*   How to use popular cloud platforms like AWS;\n*   Coding in alignment with the architectural decisions made in the project;\n*   How to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers, which is very important in establishing an effective CI/CD environment;\n*   How to review code since code reviews can unearth defects earlier in the development lifecycle.\n\n### How to find the best R developer?\n\nNow you know the skills and competencies that you need, it’s time for you to set in motion the hiring process. Take the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire R developers\n\nYou need to choose the right hiring platform. This goes a long way to ensure that you hire competent people.\n\nGeneral purpose freelance platforms can easily connect you to R developers. You might be able to bargain a favorable hourly rate, however, remember that working with freelancers can be risky.\n\nFreelancers need a stable income, therefore, they take on multiple projects. R programming can be complex, and working with part-time freelancers can be hard with complex projects.\n\nSoftware development-focused freelancer platforms are a much better place to get an R programmer. Thanks to their stringent screening processes, they only hire the good developers. However, such sites don’t offer any management support. You are left to deal with all the risks associated with freelancer developers.\n\nSoftware development companies such as DeTeam.Space can help you to hire a full-time R developer.\n\nWe have a simple and transparent contracting process where we do all the work for you. All of our developers are full-time members of our community and have been vetted to ensure that they are the best at what they do. We also implement physical, technical, and procedural safeguards such as NDAs to protect your intellectual property.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates to find top R developers\n\nNow that you have decided which hiring platform to use, you need to interview the candidates.\n\nIf you are an expert in the R programming language, you can conduct interviews. Otherwise, you need to get interview questions from Stack Overflow or similar websites. You could also ask a business associate with expertise in R to conduct the interviews.\n\nTake sufficient time and cover all the skills we have mentioned. Review the portfolios of the candidates and ask them about the complex projects that they have worked on. Ask how they have handled the various complexities in these projects.\n\nExplain your project requirements to candidates and ask them how they would approach your project. You should expect specific recommendations.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide all relevant information about your app development project\n\nDevelopers need relevant information to succeed in your project. Provide all the relevant documentation like requirements, technical solutions, etc. Introduce the R developer you hire to your larger team. Set up a process for communications.\n\nProvide the required access to the technical environment of your project. Show your code repository to the R programmer you hire. Explain the sprints in your project and describe how you will review milestones. Set accountability about deliverables and explain the roles and responsibilities. Explain the payment T&Cs. You are now ready to start them working.\n\n### Interview tips to hire R programmers\n\nThe following interview tips could help you to hire smart R software developers:\n\n#### A. Identify your critical requirements clearly first\n\nWhy do you need R developers? Answer this question first. This will help you channel your efforts effectively when you interview the candidates.\n\nAre you looking for data scientists? Do you have large-scale data analysis tasks in your project? Does your project involve data modeling? Do you need statistical software?\n\nR is one of the versatile programming languages. You can use it in data analysis projects. It’s useful in research projects that involve analyzing data at a large scale. You can use R for data extraction, data visualization, machine learning, and statistical computing. This programming language has proved its mettle in data science projects too.\n\nHowever, you need developers with relevant experience. Assess whether candidates have what you need. First, get clarity over what’s most important to you!\n\n#### B. Hire sufficiently experienced developers\n\nR is a relatively complex language. R developers need a pronounced learning curve. An R developer with the requisite experience can be an asset.\n\nDon’t plan to hire only junior developers. Evaluate the hands-on experience of the candidates. This can be hard when you interview remote R developers, and it’s harder if you interview freelance R developers.\n\nWe at Fwork LLC can make your life easier. Our vetting process ensures that you will get sufficiently experienced and skilled R programmers.\n\n#### C. Look for R programmers with experience in coding secure applications\n\nComplex tasks like data management, data manipulation, data processing, statistical analysis, etc. require a high focus on data security.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Wordpress Developers\n----------------------------------------------\n\n![WordPress Developers](./df851b14dcc17d3f97ea513c11ab9786.svg)\n\nWordPress is more than just a tool for building websites. It’s a platform that helps create the central foundation of any modern business, namely, your online presence.\n\nThe developers you choose will have a direct impact on your growth and success. That’s why the need to hire WordPress developers with great skills is so essential. What this means is that they need to offer a unique combination of technical, communication, and strategic skills.\n\n### Who Needs to Hire Top WordPress Developers?\n\nIf you’re thinking of using WordPress to build an online presence, you’re going to need to hire WordPress developers with the ability to make it happen. You might be able to whip up an acceptable looking website by yourself by following a few online tutorials, but building a beautiful, secure, and scalable WordPress application demands talent and experience. This guide is for:\n\n*   Startup founders and entrepreneurs building a new online business idea.\n*   Enterprise executives looking to streamline online operations.\n*   Anyone wanting to improve their current WordPress setup.\n\n### WordPress: A Super-Tool that Demands Super-Developers\n\nWordPress is unique in the website development world. No other platform is used by such a wide variety of organizations. The New Yorker, Sony Music, and even the country of Sweden [use it to power their websites](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/40-most-notable-big-name-brands-that-are-using-wordpress/), and startups everywhere are using WordPress to create world-class prototype web applications.\n\nThe real strengths of the WordPress platform are its:\n\n*   Thousands of themes, plugins, tools, and templates\n*   Vibrant community\n*   Ease-of-use\n*   Easy extensibility\n*   Scalability\n\nTop WordPress developers will be able to build you a minimum viable product (MVP) in no time, integrate any custom features you want, and quickly scale it up for a growing user base. This will save you money in the short term while helping you massively increase your earnings in the longer term.\n\n### The Difficulties With Finding WordPress Developers For Hire\n\nWebsite development is no easy thing. This is why you need to use the right tools and hire WordPress developers who know their stuff. When trying to find a new developer, you will likely choose to post your project to a freelance platform.\n\nWhatever you post, the response will be a tidal wave of applications promising top-quality work for low per-hour rates. If that sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.\n\nVerifying qualifications on such platforms is difficult, and some candidates that sound great on paper may end up steering your project towards disaster.\n\nAnother problem is that WordPress makes creating reasonable looking websites a piece of cake, meaning everyone has a great portfolio. It can be hard to tell who is capable of making your vision a reality, and who has just built a site from a nice looking template.\n\nBut there are many developers capable of getting your project completed, and for a reasonable price too. You just need the right approach to find them.\n\n### How this Interviewing Guide Will Help\n\nWe will start by examining what separates junior programmers from the experts, and what makes a great dev team. Then we’ll go through a step-by-step process that you can use to find the best developers.\n\nNaturally, you want to identify the top developers without spending too much time and money. The objectives are to:\n\n1.  Weed out the unskilled as quickly as possible.\n2.  Uncover real _breadth and depth of understanding_ – not just knowledge.\n3.  Avoid boring good developers with a tedious interview process. Rather, we want to attract talent by presenting your project as something great to work on.\n\n### What Separates WordPress Experts from the Rest\n\nHiring a cheap $ 20-per-hour freelance programmer with a good-looking portfolio might seem like a good idea now, but it can turn out to be an expensive mistake. Some junior developers charge rock-bottom rates, but hiring them presents risks. Junior developers may:\n\n*   Have a limited skillset\n*   Take _far too long_ to do the required tasks\n*   Fail to understand what you mean\n*   Struggle to communicate effectively\n*   Try to cover up mistakes\n*   Make expensive mistakes that only reveal themselves later\n*   Struggle to solve problems unique to your business\n*   Not have the experience or insight to make helpful suggestions\n\nExpert WordPress developers won’t have these problems. However, “expertise” or “seniority” can’t just be measured in qualifications and years of experience.\n\nThere are many qualified developers with 10+ years of experience who should still be classed as juniors.\n\nThere are also developers out there with only a couple of years of experience and no qualifications who are already building world-class applications.\n\n### Essential WordPress Web Developer Skills\n\nHere are the real indicators of top-level WordPress web developers.\n\n#### 1\\. Breadth and Depth of Technical Skills\n\nThe minimum requirement for any developer or software engineer is a good technical skill set and a reasonable understanding of the industry that they are working in. WordPress developers need a good knowledge of web development and a deep understanding of how everything works together.\n\nThe essential technical skills are:\n\nBasic Skills:\n\n*   Web development skills including PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and JavaScript\n*   An understanding of how the WordPress core works\n*   Knowledge of WordPress hosting\n*   Familiarity with post types and WordPress taxonomies\n*   Knowledge of popular themes and plugins\n*   The ability to integrate with social media platforms\n\nMore Advanced Skills:\n\n*   Modifying and designing custom themes\n*   Extending WordPress with custom plugins\n*   Using the WordPress API\n*   Using scalable cloud hosting\n*   User interface design\n*   Optimizing for better load times and performance\n*   Search engine optimization\n*   Setting up analytics and customer behavior tracking\n*   Web security\n*   Mastery of the underlying concepts and how all of these things come together\n\nThe basics can be mastered by any individual. This person will be able to set up a basic website and add features such as payment gateways etc.\n\nFor more complex projects, it’s best to go with a development team or WordPress development company that includes multiple specialists.\n\nIt might sound like a big step, but a small team can do the same work in a fraction of the time, something which can actually save you money.\n\nPerhaps the most important skill for WordPress development is knowing exactly how **best to** leverage all of the available tools, plugins, and templates.\n\nThis will slash development time further. Your dev team might be able to build you a cool eCommerce plugin, but it’s pointless if there is already one available.\n\nFor WordPress, technical prowess leads to faster load times, tighter security, fewer plugin problems, better reliability, less downtime, better user experience, and fewer maintenance headaches.\n\n#### 2\\. Communication and “Soft” Skills\n\nSoft skills like communication and attitude are just as important as hard skills. Technical skill is no good if a developer is working on the wrong problem. A dedicated WordPress developer has great:\n\n*   Communication\n*   Adaptability\n*   Teamwork\n*   Attitude\n*   Work ethic\n*   Common sense and decision making\n*   Critical thinking\n*   Ego management\n\n[Check out this article on developer soft skills](https://www.netguru.co/blog/9-soft-skills-every-web-developer-should-master) for more details.\n\n#### 3\\. Armed with an Understanding of How Online Business Works.\n\nWordPress developers can have a big influence on how your online business operates. Experts know this and keep their strategic skills up-to-date along with their technical ones. This includes things like:\n\n*   Anticipating possible problems and performance bottlenecks\n*   Future scalability\n*   Efficient use of cloud computing resources\n*   Optimizing for Google and other search engines\n*   Improving user experience\n*   Thinking of creative solutions that make potential problems disappear\n\nTips for non-technical people:\n\nAn expert developer will have these qualities:\n\n1.  The ability to relate their **technical skills** and requirements simply to you. They can explain to you in simple language why a certain programming language, tool, or plugin is the right choice.\n2.  They are easy to **communicate with**. You shouldn’t have to repeat yourself or be forced to keep asking for explanations and clarifications.\n3.  They understand your **project vision** and your business. They don’t need their hand held along the way. Also, they care about long-term goals. They offer helpful suggestions and insights and can anticipate problems such as roadblocks.\n\n### What Makes an Expert WordPress Dev Team?\n\nIf you want more than just a basic WordPress setup, it’s a good idea to go with a professional dev team rather than an individual.\n\nThere are lots of companies offering WordPress development services out there. Once again, lots of research and making sure to ask the right questions are the key to finding the right team.\n\nA good team should cover a wide range of skills, with multiple specialists working together to get the best results.\n\nEach of the individual members should have the necessary developer qualities. However, teams of developers need to have some special qualities, too. Here are some of the factors to look out for:\n\n#### 1\\. They Work Seamlessly as a Unit\n\nJust like a great sports team, functioning as a coherent unit and following a strong gameplan is much more important than having a team of individual superstars.\n\nEveryone needs to know their place in the team. Strong leadership and a clear team structure will ensure that top quality work is delivered consistently. Good teams may have one or two junior developers, but their limitations should be understood to ensure that they produce great code quality.\n\nThe developers should also have complementary skill sets and know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. These things together will ensure that code is comprehensive, reliable, and works flawlessly.\n\n#### 2\\. They Have Great Internal and External Communication\n\nGood internal communication means that developers talk to each other, and always know who is working on what. External communication relates to the management and client (when applicable). Remember, as the manager or client, you should always be in the loop. This includes things like:\n\n*   Who’s working on what\n*   Who’s responsible\n*   What’s been completed\n*   Current progress and deadlines\n*   Budget management\n\nThe best WordPress development teams never make themselves indispensable. With each new completed feature or project, they should show you how it works, and how to use it without them.\n\n#### 3\\. They Have a Positive Team Culture.\n\nOversized egos can make a team of otherwise competent developers crash and burn. Blaming each other for mistakes, passing the buck, competitiveness, and arguing – all of these things are a waste of everyone’s time and often lead to failed projects.\n\nA team’s culture should be based on honest communication, helping each other out, and collaborating towards success.\n\n### Working with a Team vs an Individual Freelancer\n\nWorking with an individual developer is a popular approach. For a small scale project, it keeps things simple. However, when projects get larger than a simple setup, you’re probably going to need a team.\n\nWorking with an individual can be risky, especially for larger or enterprise projects. After all, you are putting the fate of your entire project in the hands of one person. A team is more likely to have the depth of knowledge to make your project successful. A typical WordPress team should have UX, backend, mobile, API, and SEO specialists – making it more likely you’ll get quality code.\n\nAnother major aspect is development speed. A team of three developers can probably do the work of 1/3 of the time.\n\nThat means they bill you for the same number of hours, but things get done three times as fast. This is particularly important when scaling. A team can also spend more time on your project at key times. A single developer can become a bottleneck.\n\n### Tips for interviewing professional WordPress developers\n\nWe recommend the following best practices when interviewing WordPress professionals:\n\n#### A. Look for experience in developing WordPress themes and plugins\n\nYou want a developer with experience in WordPress theme development. You also want WordPress plugin development experience.\n\nSuch developers have much more skills and experience than average WordPress developers. Custom theme development can be complex, which is also true for plugin development.\n\nNeedless to say, you need to pay more than the average WordPress developer salary. The higher costs are worth though.\n\nExpert developers have wider exposure to web development services. They help in debugging and web application security, and we will talk about that shortly.\n\n#### B. Look for debugging experience\n\nYou need to prioritize debugging skills and experience. Many WordPress projects can be complex. They require much more than just designing WordPress sites with a great look and feel.\n\nProgrammers need in-depth PHP skills when debugging WordPress websites. Quality WordPress developers also have considerable MySQL skills. Even more important is the experience in debugging complex WordPress websites.\n\nYou could find it hard to assess debugging skills when you interview remote WordPress developers. You might face the same challenge with freelance WordPress developers.\n\nThis is why you should hire WordPress developers from hybrid software development companies like Fwork LLC. Fwork LLC follows a stringent screening process for developers.\n\n#### C. Assess the skills and experience in preventing security issues\n\nWe talked about web security earlier, however, we can’t restate its importance enough! WordPress is popular. However, hackers routinely target it. Hire a WordPress developer that can prevent web security issues.\n\nExpert WordPress developers should check all the themes and plugins they use for security loopholes. They should also check the application security aspects when customizing themes and plugins. Developers should have experience in resolving issues found in security and compliance testing.\n\nIt’s not enough to write this point when you put up the requirements on a job board. You need to evaluate this aspect keenly when hiring WordPress developers. Ask for project references and evaluate those WordPress sites.\n\n### Interview Questions and Answers to Identify Top-Level Developers\n\nYour interview processes should be done in stages. Due to the time this takes, there is no way you can comprehensively interview dozens of developers for a position. That’s why each stage is designed to cut down your candidate pool so you have more time per developer on the next stage.\n\n1.  _Basic screening stage_ – Finding the developers who meet the minimum requirements\n2.  _In-depth technical knowledge and ability_ – Pinpointing developers who can really understand your unique challenges\n3.  _Strategic knowledge_ – Homing in on the best WordPress developers who can help take your business to the next level\n\n#### Step 1: Basic Screening Stage\n\nThe first stage is about removing unqualified candidates in an efficient way. The questions should be to do with logistics such as minimum experience, location, rates, and language requirements.\n\nExample Questions:\n\n*   How well do you speak English (or whatever language you need)? 1 – 10\n*   How well do you write in English? 1 – 10\n*   How many years of experience do you have with WordPress?\n*   Do you have any examples of a WordPress website you have built?\n*   How many WordPress projects have you worked on?\n*   Are you familiar with (specific technology, e.g. AWS)\n*   Where are you based?\n*   Are you planning to work part-time?\n\nQuestions for Teams:\n\n*   Who will I be communicating with?\n*   What project management tool do you use? What access will I have?\n*   Do you use agile?\n*   How well does your contact person speak English?\n*   How well do your developers chat in English?\n*   Are you a full-stack dev team (means you have both very strong backend engineers and very strong frontend developers)?\n*   Number of people on the team who have more than 3 years of frontend experience\n\nAfter that, you can start with the technical questions. They can be simple or complex questions, but they must have a right or wrong answer.\n\n### Example WordPress Technical Questions:\n\nQ: Name the two types of hooks in WordPress\n\nA: Action hooks and filter hooks Example of a filter hook\n\n    <?php add_filter( ‘the_content’, ‘head_func’ );\n     function head_func( $content ) {\n        if ( is_single() ) {\n           $content .= ‘Filter hook example’ . ” “;\n        }\n        return $content;\n     }\n    ?>\n\nQ: Add the minimum required header for this plugin called “My hello world plugin”\n\n    <?php\n    add_filter('the_content', 'hello_world');\n    function hello_world($content){\n        return $content . \"<h1> Hello World </h1>\";\n    }\n    ?>\n\nA:\n\n    <?php\n    /*\n    Plugin Name: My hello world plugin\n    */\n    add_filter('the_content', 'hello_world');\n    function hello_world($content){\n        return $content . \"<h1> Hello World </h1>\";\n    }\n    ?>\n\nWrite an improved version of this WordPress function using the $wpdb variable\n\n    <?php\n    Write an improvedfunction perform_database_action(){\n         mysql_query(“INSERT into table_name (col1, col2, col3)\n            VALUES ('$value1','$value2', '$value3');\n    }\n    ?>\n\nA:\n\n    <?php\n    function perform_database_action(){\n        global $wpdb;\n        $data= array('col1'=>$value1,'col2'=>$value2,'col3'=>$value3);\n        $format = array('%s','%s','%s');\n        $wpdb->insert('table_name', $data, $format);\n    }\n    ?>\n\nFor the first questions, you need to work out what “incorrect” is based on your requirements, i.e. a minimum English proficiency, minimum number of years experience, etc.\n\nThe questions shouldn’t take too much time for good developers, but don’t make the quiz too long. You don’t want to bore your best candidates. Anyone who fails the compulsory questions or to get an overall minimum score should be removed from your shortlist.\n\nIf you’re doing a lot of interviews, you can also try to automate this stage with an automated online form.\n\n#### Step 2: In-depth Technical Knowledge and Ability\n\nThis is where you are going to find out which of the candidates left on your list are actually talented developers.\n\nAsking difficult technical questions doesn’t really help you distinguish between experienced developers and those who have just finished studying and have the information fresh in their minds.\n\nThe best way to do this is with open-ended questions to complex problems – preferably to do with your specific project.\n\nGive a complex scenario and ask them how they would best approach it. The less time you give them to prepare answers, the better. Use a variety of questions, including ones on the development processes, timeframes, technologies they’ll need for the project.\n\nExample Questions:\n\n*   What steps do you take to make sure a product is scalable?\n*   What are the most important things you think about when designing a user interface?\n*   How long would it take you to get an MVP for this project? Give me a breakdown of the components\n*   We need a plugin to do (example). How might you start coding something like this?\n*   Describe how you would go about setting up services/configurations to perform an action on the database once a day? What are some things you would take into account when deciding the time of day?\n*   How does a WordPress API work? What can it be used for?\n*   How have you improved page load times before?\n*   Briefly describe how the WooCommerce plugin works?\n*   What’s the best theme available? Show an example of where you have used it on a project\n*   Have you ever undertaken theme development or theme customization?\n*   What plugin development have you undertaken?\n*   Do you have any WordPress themes or plugins published in the WordPress directory?\n\nThere are no definitive answers to these questions. The idea is to expose how a developer approaches problems as well as the depth of their knowledge. When you get answers like this from multiple developers, the top-level developers quickly stand out. Their answers will make the most sense.\n\nAsking for some code examples is a good idea too. There are plenty of places you can get them checked if you can’t do it yourself.\n\n#### Step 3: Strategic Knowledge\n\nYou’ve cut down your list to the best two or three WordPress programmers. All of them meet your minimum requirements, and all of them have the ability to get your project done. Now it’s time to find the one who is going to deliver your business the most value.\n\nThis part of the interview should ideally be done via video chat, or at least on a live message chat. The questions will be open-ended and the interaction should be very relaxed. You can ask questions on:\n\n*   [SEO strategy](https://www.Fwork LLC/blog/5-seo-practices/)\n*   Future forecasts\n*   Technology choices\n*   Building custom themes, plugins, etc\n*   Different tools to use\n*   How to cut current costs / streamline processes\n*   Content strategy\n*   Past WordPress jobs\n\nExample Questions:\n\n*   How would you use cloud infrastructure to make a WordPress site more scalable? What platform would you use and why?\n*   Describe how you’ve used Search Engine Optimization in a past WordPress site\n*   Describe the technologies you would use to complete this project. What are the tradeoffs involved in using them?\n*   What value do you think my customers will get out of this project?\n*   What tools are currently popular in the WordPress ecosystem? How are they providing value?\n\n### Interviewing Teams\n\nThe process will be slightly different for teams. Once a team has passed your minimum requirements test and technical skills, you will want to test how they communicate with you so you establish how communication will work during your project.\n\nGetting the team on a group chat or call for an interview will give you an insight into how they operate. If you ask a question about a specific topic, the team member that has the best knowledge in that area should lead the response – with other team members chipping in where necessary.\n\nYou are looking for the qualities we talked about in the dev teams section – working as a unit, good communication with you and each other, and a positive team culture.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWordPress truly is an amazing CMS. With the right developers, it can be used to take your organization to the next level of success. Luckily, there are many great developers and teams out there waiting to add real value to your project.\n\nWith the knowledge and interview structure discussed above, you’ll be able to secure the services of the talented developers you need for your project quickly and with total confidence.\n\nWhy not start your search by filling out a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form so you can see the vast range of field expert developers in our community.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Blockchain Developers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Blockchain Developers](./60a6167cb88897c0542f63cafe45d81e.svg)\n\nIt was only a few years ago that almost no one had heard of blockchain. Thanks to the enormous gain in popularity of the blockchain-based cryptocurrency Bitcoin, today, blockchain is one of the hottest areas in the software development world.\n\nA decentralized distributed ledger technology, blockchain has taken the world by storm, and for good reason. It has the power to disrupt traditional business models via its greater transparency, improved security, immutability, and reduced costs.\n\nIf we bear all this in mind, it’s only logical that government agencies, supply chains, healthcare, and other industries will be looking to implement blockchain solutions in some form or other in the near future. This will allow them to benefit from the advantages that it offers over current solutions.\n\nNaturally, with so many benefits, companies are rushing to hire blockchain developers as fast as they can to build the next generation of software solutions.\n\n### Finding Reliable Blockchain Developers for Hire\n\nThe problem begins with the lack of experienced blockchain developers out there. Though this number is growing every month, the Bitcoin boom caught the industry off guard somewhat as it started a huge gold rush for blockchain programmers.\n\nAs a result, today, the best blockchain developers command some of the highest average salaries in the industry. Skilled developers are always in need when it comes to blockchain. This makes them hard to find.\n\nThe second component of the problem is that blockchain technologies are developing so quickly. One example of this is the blockchain-based smart contract, which is growing in complexity and sophistication every day.\n\nWith blockchain blocks being immutable once written, any smart contract added to a blockchain will be incredibly difficult to alter. This means that all such code must be flawless.\n\nBut don’t let these two points put you off, there are still lots of available blockchain experts out there. You just need to know where to look.\n\n### Onboarding Developers vs. Outsourcing Developers vs. Outsourcing Project Development\n\nThe first question anyone planning to undertake blockchain development needs to ask themselves is whether to scale their existing in-house team, hire freelancers, or to outsource developers from a specialist blockchain development company.\n\nAlternatively, if your company does not have the human resources, then should you go the safe route and outsource to a full-time software development company?\n\nWell, naturally, that decision depends on a number of things including your human and budget resources.\n\nThe main difference between hiring freelancers and hiring dedicated outsource company developers is the cost, and more importantly, security.\n\nWhile costing more, it is far more likely that an outsourcing company will have vetted its blockchain experts.\n\nThis is a far better guarantee for quality than taking a coder’s word for it on a freelancer platform, which typically offers client companies no protection for project delays, poorly written code, or even the theft of your intellectual property.\n\n#### Hiring From Outsource Company Tip:\n\nWhen hiring a developer from an outsource company or outsourcing your web or app development, always make sure they have full-time vetted developers working for them.\n\nOverall, choosing to outsource your entire development process to an outsource company is the safest option, provided that you ensure that they tick all the boxes including protecting your intellectual property rights.\n\n### How Can I Find a Blockchain Developer?\n\nWith literally thousands of freelancer platforms and software development companies out there, the problem can seem more one of being overwhelmed rather than not being able to find anywhere to connect to blockchain professionals.\n\nHowever, as we have already pointed out, good blockchain developers are at a premium. Lots will claim they have the experience, but few do.\n\n#### Freelancer Platform\n\nFreelancer sites are undoubtedly a great place to find cheap freelancers. They allow project managers to quickly connect to vast pools of developers. Since there is such competition, hourly rates are squeezed to a minimum meaning that it is not hard to find a low-cost developer.\n\nUnfortunately, going this route could end up causing you no end of headaches.\n\nTo start with, many take an exorbitant 20% cut from their freelancers. This is definitely something freelancers notice when it comes to payday. So, unless you are willing to cover part, if not all of that fee, it is likely that your freelancer will be a little demoralized by this.\n\nAlternatively, you can opt for software development-specific platforms that have the edge as they are more specifically focused on the software development industry. You are far more likely to find a good blockchain freelancer on such dedicated sites when compared to general-purpose freelancer sites.\n\nHowever, these sites also have their drawbacks. They offer very little in the way of help with project management or project management tools. Unless you have experience developing blockchain solutions then you should opt for a managed solution.\n\nIf you want well-vetted developers or dev teams and the tools to manage them, or just want to completely outsource your project development, you will need to hire an experienced software development company.\n\nThese companies represent the safest and surest route to project success. They underwrite the work of all their developers so if you are not satisfied then you don’t need to pay. Some of these companies also only employ full-time developers who they performance manage and train to use the latest technologies.\n\n#### How to find the best Software Development Company\n\nReview sites are a great place to start looking when trying to outsource your blockchain development.\n\nThe best of these include Clutch.co and Trustpilot.com. On sites such as these, it is possible to search by the number of stars or if you have a specific company in mind, you can search by its name and read all the feedback and comments given by past clients.\n\nShortlist the companies that appeal to you most, then hit their websites and let them know about your project.\n\nFor Fwork LLC, [simply submit a project specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) and one of our dedicated account managers will get back to you to answer any questions that you might have.\n\nBe sure to get answers to all the questions you might have before committing to any development company or hiring any blockchain developer.\n\nBe sure to make sure you have answers to the following questions:\n\n*   What is their level of experience?\n*   Do they have example projects you can see?\n*   What the developer/company will do and when\n*   How often will you get performance updates?\n*   What happens if work is not completed to your satisfaction?\n*   What management roles/tasks will you need to perform?\n*   Ownership rights and security of your intellectual property and idea\n*   How the completed code will be stored/transferred to you\n*   The situation when it comes to offloading the developer/development company\n*   Price estimate\n\n### Skills to Look for When Looking to Hire Blockchain Developers\n\nThere is a wide range of different blockchain ‘specialists’ working in the field of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. These include project managers, blockchain engineers, blockchain developers, smart contract developers, etc.\n\nGiven that the range of tasks blockchain developers undertake could be anything from creating a new digital currency, and coding smart contracts in Hyperledger Fabric, to integrating a blockchain feature into a mobile app or creating a DApp, they need robust skills and a deep understanding of the technology of blockchain as a whole.\n\nHere are some of the top skills to look for in a blockchain development specialist:\n\n1.  **Programming languages**. When recruiting blockchain developers, it’s essential to look for certain programming language skills. C++ is by far the most popular language in the blockchain industry, which makes it a critical skill for every blockchain developer. However, being pretty mature, this language has some drawbacks, one of which is the fact that it’s not designed to facilitate the coding of smart contracts. Apart from being fluent in C++, your candidates should also be well-versed in the following languages:\n    \n    *   Node.js, which is suitable for backend;\n    *   React or Angular for frontend;\n    *   Simplicity or Solidity for Smart Contracts;\n    *   Golang for console clients and backend.\n    \n    In other words, what you need is a multifaceted, full-stack developer who’s proficient in the languages currently at the cutting edge of blockchain development.\n    \n2.  **A deep understanding** of multiple cryptocurrency frameworks. The best option is to find a developer with a good understanding of different blockchain technology applications, crypto-economic protocols, and multiple cryptocurrency frameworks. In essence, your ideal blockchain development candidate should be a blockchain aficionado who has also dabbled in crypto mining and trading. Keep in mind that prior to 2017, the vast majority of blockchain developers were doing it out of passion and not for money. However, you will need to make sure all your developers have a good understanding of blockchain technology and whatever blockchain network you plan to use. With Ethereum, for example, they should know how to code in Solidity, understand how its smart contracts function, and know the rules of the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM, etc.\n3.  **Extensive knowledge of decentralized applications**. When interviewing your candidates, it’s important to check whether they have previously built decentralized apps, as well as whether they have received cybersecurity training in decentralized apps.\n4.  **Expertise in smart contracts**. It’s best to go for a certified smart contract developer and make sure that your new hire is capable of creating smart contracts on any blockchain platform using a language such as Solidity.\n5.  **An extensive GitHub portfolio featuring different blockchain projects**. This is particularly important if you’re not blockchain-savvy, as these portfolios help you establish whether your candidate has the necessary experience and expertise.\n6.  **A background in UX design**. Creating a superb blockchain project is one thing, making it user-friendly and intuitive is something completely different. That’s why it is a great idea to hire someone who is experienced both in blockchain technology and user experience design. In a nutshell, you will need to make sure all your developers have a good understanding of blockchain technology and in whatever blockchain network and technologies that you plan to use.\n\n### The Value of Experience\n\nExperience in blockchain development is a must. For reasons that we have already outlined, the price of failure when it comes to developing a blockchain solution can be high.\n\nIn order to evaluate a developer or development company’s experience, you have to do your homework. Begin by reading their testimonials on their website and review sites such as Clutch.co.\n\nYou should then check the applications or software that they claim to have built.\n\nIf you can find a similar project to your own, playing around with it will not only give you an idea of the level of work that your developer has been involved in but also might give you a few more ideas for your project.\n\n### How to Manage Your Blockchain Developer\n\nSoftware development is often a high-pressure environment. While some companies choose to go the route of slow development, often undertaken by a part-time surfer/part-time developer, most companies want to get their ideas up and running as soon as possible.\n\nThe key to managing an unknown developer is good management, and the key to good management is communication.\n\nBefore you start collaborating with your developer, walk them through your project, your approach, what you expect of them, and when.\n\nThis might sound obvious, but you would be amazed just how many employees are out there who have only a limited idea of what is going on with a project or even where it is at.\n\nSuch information not only fosters a team spirit but also helps developers to offer valuable insights into project development. Such insights help to prevent avoidable roadblocks and other time and money-consuming problems.\n\nBe sure to show your new developer all the tools that you will use to aid project development. It is important for any project manager to be able to maintain a clear oversight as to where the project is and how each developer is performing.\n\nWhile the part-time surfer/part-time developer might not like this idea, such information allows the manager to keep all the developers in the place they should be. If other developers are forced to wait because a task has not been completed by another member of the team, well, this can cause immense frustration to say the least.\n\nBe sure to ask any development company about the tools that they use to manage their projects and whether they will be available to you should you engage one of their developers or dev teams.\n\n### Interview tips for hiring blockchain developers\n\nWe suggest the following for you when you hire blockchain software developers:\n\n#### A. Specify the type of blockchain development project in the blockchain developer job description\n\nMake an early decision about your project scope. What do you want to offer? Do you want to launch a public blockchain-based app or an enterprise blockchain app? Do you need only web app development, or do you need mobile app development too?\n\nSpecify the requirements clearly in the job ad. Otherwise, you might receive applications from too many blockchain developers. Many of them might not have the skills that you need. E.g., if you want to offer a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain app, then software developers with Ethereum development skills will not help.\n\nBy specifying the requirements clearly, you can get applications from the right people. You can then focus more on interviewing the software engineers.\n\n#### B. Check the knowledge of software development tools when hiring Ethereum developers\n\nDo you plan to hire Ethereum blockchain software developers? Evaluate their knowledge of tools like Truffle, MetaMask, Web3.js, etc. Hire a blockchain developer with in-depth knowledge of these tools.\n\nThis evaluation can be hard if you interview remote blockchain developers. It can be harder if you look for freelance blockchain developers.\n\nThis is another reason why you should hire blockchain engineers from a hybrid software development company like Fwork LLC. Such companies assess their developers diligently. You have better chances of finding qualified blockchain programmers.\n\n#### C. Look for enterprise blockchain developers that are up-to-date with technological advancements\n\nDo you plan to offer an enterprise blockchain app? You need a blockchain development team that’s up-to-date with technological advancements.\n\nBlockchain development can be complex. Enterprise blockchain development is harder. Providers of enterprise blockchain platforms are trying to make it easier. They are developing several useful frameworks and tools for that. Senior blockchain developers should keep themselves well aware of these developments.\n\nYou should assess their knowledge in this regard. This assessment is hard when hiring freelance blockchain developers. Freelance blockchain developers show a project portfolio. You find it hard to assess their real contribution to those projects though.\n\nCompanies like Fwork LLC do the “heavy lifting” for you upfront. Hire qualified blockchain programmers from such companies.\n\n### Sample interview questions when hiring blockchain developers\n\nWhen you try to find blockchain developers, ask questions that assess their hands-on knowledge. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### A. What are the common smart contract vulnerabilities?\n\n**Answer:** The most common smart contract vulnerabilities are as follows:\n\n*   Indirect execution of unknown code;\n*   Reentrancy;\n*   Incorrect calculation of the output token amount;\n*   Interface issues;\n*   Dependency on the order of execution;\n*   Time component-related errors;\n*   Errors due to using the blockhash function;\n*   Exception handling-related errors.\n\n#### B. Which Ethereum standard should you use when developing a non-fungible token?\n\n**Answer:** You should use the ERC-721 standard to create an NFT (non-fungible token). This Ethereum standard helps you to create cryptographic tokens that are unique and indivisible. You need to code Ethereum smart contracts that follow the ERC-721 standard to create NFTs.\n\n#### C. How do you create a blockchain application using Node.js?\n\n**Answer:** Take the following steps:\n\n*   Choose a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform like Amazon Managed Blockchain or Azure Blockchain Workbench.\n*   Install the Hyperledger Fabric framework.\n*   Use the Hyperledger Fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js.\n*   Create, test, and deploy the blockchain application by following the instructions offered by the BaaS platform of your choice.\n\nCheck out our blockchain interview questions for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nFinding talented and well-versed blockchain developers for hire is a challenging task, especially if you’re not an expert in the field.\n\nBlockchain is a real challenge to businesses wishing to create new solutions using the technology. While these are definitely hurdles to overcome, with the aid of experienced blockchain developers they need not be very big ones.\n\nYou are welcome to contact us by filling out a [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started/) form to ask about our field expert blockchain developers.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire JavaScript Developers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nJavaScript emerged on the scene more than 2 decades ago, and it remains one of the most popular languages even today. This open-source language offers many advantages, which are as follows:\n\n*   This dynamically-typed language provides plenty of flexibility.\n*   It makes web development easy.\n*   JavaScript integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS, which makes website development easier.\n*   Programmers can use excellent open-source libraries like jQuery, React, etc. when they work with JavaScript.\n*   The rich ecosystem of JavaScript offers many advantages. For example, Node.js, the popular runtime environment is based on JavaScript.\n*   JavaScript programmers don’t need to spend time setting up an environment for JavaScript development. All modern web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc. support JavaScript.\n*   Coders can use many popular JavaScript-based frameworks like Vue.js, Express.js, Ember.js, AngularJS, etc., which makes development easy.\n*   Not just web applications, but you can use JavaScript-based libraries like React for developing mobile applications too.\n*   JavaScript works very well with MongoDB, the popular NoSQL database.\n*   It also works well with Ajax, which makes it easier to develop web applications that don’t interfere with the display of existing web pages.\n*   JavaScript helps to create performant and scalable web applications and websites.\n\nThis isn’t an exhaustive list of the advantages of JavaScript, but you get the point! You can see why JavaScript has such high demands and why full-stack developers with JavaScript skills get such high salaries in the United States!\n\nHiring JavaScript experts can be hard! You need to choose between part-time freelancers and full-time dedicated JavaScript developers, therefore, you need to choose the appropriate hiring platform.\n\nYou need to interview them. Look for the following skills in a JavaScript developer:\n\n### JavaScript development skills\n\nJavaScript programmers should have the following primary technical skills:\n\n*   JavaScript including its strengths and limitations;\n*   HTML5 and CSS3;\n*   JavaScript frameworks and libraries like AngularJS, jQuery, Express.js, Ember.js, ReactJS, React Native, Vue.js, etc.;\n*   Node.js;\n*   Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.;\n*   NoSQL databases like MongoDB;\n*   Ajax.\n\nThey also need a thorough knowledge of the following:\n\n*   Asynchronous programming;\n*   Web design;\n*   Best practices to deliver a great user experience;\n*   How to use JavaScript to develop scalable and performant web applications;\n*   How to use frameworks like React Native to develop near-native mobile applications.\n\n### Other app development skills that JavaScript developers need\n\nLook for the following additional technical skills when you hire JavaScript developers:\n\n#### A. Other programming language skills\n\nJavaScript is a powerful language, however, effective developers need a thorough knowledge of one or more key languages. Take the example of PHP. It’s a very good scripting language for server-side scripting, whereas JavaScript is excellent for client-side scripting.\n\nMany software development projects involving JavaScript have more complexity than simple e-Commerce development. A JS developer that knows the strengths of PHP along with JavaScript can contribute far more to such projects.\n\nEven for simple projects like WordPress development, you might have customized requirements. For example, you might need to add JavaScript code to WordPress pages. Having a good knowledge of PHP can help here.\n\n#### B. API development skills\n\nDeveloping your own 1st party APIs can help since APIs provide a consistent framework for the front-end of your application to access the back-end. Look for a web developer with JavaScript skills that knows how to develop RESTful APIs since REST (Representational State Transfer) is the de-facto standard for API development.\n\nHire JavaScript developers that know the following:\n\n*   How to use API development and documentation tools;\n*   How to host APIs using a cloud platform;\n*   Using modern databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB to develop the back-end;\n*   How to secure APIs using techniques like authentication token, encryption, quotas, throttling, etc.;\n*   How to create effective rules for API requests and responses.\n\n#### C. In-depth knowledge of cloud platforms\n\nYou will likely use a cloud platform for your app development project. Managed cloud services providers like AWS or Microsoft Azure handle the infrastructure provisioning and management, which saves time for you.\n\nThe type of cloud platform you use depends on your software development project. For example, if you are developing web applications, then a “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) platform will help.\n\nPaaS platforms manage cloud infrastructure, networking, storage, operating system, runtime environments, etc. This enables you to focus on development. Reputed PaaS platforms have robust DevOps tools and auto-scaling solutions. Look for JavaScript programmers that are familiar with popular PaaS platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, use a “Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service” (MBaaS) platform if you are developing mobile applications. MBaaS platforms manage the infrastructure, persistent storage, etc., therefore, you don’t have to spend a high amount of time on mobile backend development. Hire JavaScript developers that know popular MBaaS platforms like AWS Amplify.\n\n#### D. The understanding of the strengths and limitations of the JavaScript ecosystem\n\nJavaScript has a very rich ecosystem! You can achieve a lot if you know the strengths of this ecosystem. At the same time, there are a few limitations of JavaScript and its ecosystem. JavaScript experts should know them so that they can use appropriate workarounds.\n\nAn example of the strengths of this ecosystem is the rich collection of open-source tools and frameworks for Node.js. Whether you are developing an e-commerce site or a more complex app, the open-source Node.js tools and frameworks can expedite your project.\n\nLet’s consider an example of a limitation. Take React Native for example. This JavaScript-based framework can help you to build near-native mobile applications.\n\nYou can run a React Native app on both Android and iOS with a very high degree of code reuse. This keeps your development and maintenance costs under control.\n\nReact Native can deliver a far more near-native user experience than other hybrid frameworks like Apache Cordova or Ionic. However, it falls short of native user experience since native apps can seamlessly use device-specific hardware features.\n\nWhile this is a limitation, JavaScript developers with years of experience know how to work around this. By using native modules along with React Native, they can overcome this limitation.\n\nHire JavaScript developers that know the strengths and limitations of this vibrant ecosystem. This improves the chances of success of your project.\n\n#### E. Application security knowledge\n\nJavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. While this gives it a lot of flexibility, there are chances of variable type-related errors that are hard to debug. This can give rise to vulnerabilities in the program and hackers are experts in exploiting vulnerabilities in the code! You need JavaScript experts that know how to code secure applications.\n\nThey need to know the following:\n\n*   How to proactively identify key application security risks like injection, broken authentication, etc.;\n*   How to use tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, etc. to secure applications;\n*   The importance of including application security and compliance testing in the CI/CD pipeline proactively instead of treating them as the last task in the project.\n\n#### F. The knowledge of succeeding in software development projects\n\nA JavaScript developer needs the following skills and competencies to succeed in a software development project:\n\n*   Knowledge of “Model-View-Controller” (MVC) and other popular design patterns;\n*   Code review experience;\n*   The ability to work with web design practitioners so that the code reflects the user interface design principles;\n*   The ability to collaborate with testers and DevOps engineers;\n*   Familiarity with GitHub, popular DevOps tools, and other modern development tools.\n\n### How to hire the best JavaScript developers?\n\nNow that you have clarity on the skills required, you should take the following steps:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide whether to hire JavaScript developers from websites providing freelancers or a JavaScript development company\n\nYou need to decide carefully about the hiring platform you choose. If you hire the right people, then your chances of success increase. On the other hand, hiring incompetent people can create serious deviations from your budget, schedule, and quality objectives. Turning troubled projects around can be hard, therefore, prevent your project from becoming a troubled one!\n\nYou can hire JavaScript developers from freelancer platforms. General-purpose freelancer sites can help you to get a part-time developer at a low rate. Freelancer platforms that focus on software development claim to have stringent screening processes, therefore, you can find high-quality developers there.\n\nThese freelancer platforms don’t provide any project management support though. You are left to manage part-time freelancers that might work on multiple projects simultaneously. These platforms deduct up to 20% of the earnings of the freelancers, which can demotivate many freelancers. They may leave your project, which exposes you to more risks.\n\nFor complex projects, hiring dedicated JavaScript developers makes more sense. A software development company will be a better bet for you in this case since such companies provide full-time developers. They can provide replacement if the original developer leaves the project.\n\nSoftware development companies appreciate that you might be using sensitive corporate information as part of your project. They implement physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to protect your sensitive data. This is another key advantage. Analyze your project requirements carefully and choose a hiring platform.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the candidates to find top JavaScript developers\n\nNow that you chose a hiring platform, you need to interview the candidates. If you know JavaScript well, then you can interview. Alternatively, ask for help from a knowledgeable associate or get interview questions from the Internet.\n\nRemember to cover all the technical skill areas that we have highlighted. Focus on project experience and not just testimonials. Ask the candidates about the complex projects that they have worked on. Find out how they managed to deal with the complexities.\n\nExplain your project requirements and ask how they would approach them. Look for specific recommendations and not just high-level statements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide relevant details about your JavaScript development project\n\nYou need to provide the required details of your application development project for the new software developer to be successful. Provide business requirements, technical solution documents, test plans, etc. You need to introduce the new developer to your larger team and explain his/her responsibilities.\n\nDescribe the technical environment of your project and provide the required access to the new developers. Show your code repository on GitHub or other tools that you use. Explain your project schedule and key milestones. Describe how you review and approve milestones. Explain the payment T&Cs to the new developer.\n\n### Interview tips for hiring JavaScript developers\n\nConsider the following interview tips when you hire a JavaScript developer:\n\n#### A. Focus on productivity when you interview JavaScript developers\n\nJavaScript offers numerous ways to improve the productivity of your team. However, you need the right JavaScript developers to utilize these features.\n\nFreelance JavaScript developers might not have the required depth of knowledge. A freelance JavaScript developer might show a portfolio of projects. However, you find it hard to gauge the relevant experience.\n\nHire from hybrid software development companies like Fwork LLC. We have the best JavaScript developers with the right experience.\n\n#### B. Assess the knowledge of key frameworks and libraries: An important JavaScript-developer-hiring step\n\nA wide range of open-source frameworks, libraries, and tools helps a JavaScript developer. Website development project teams can achieve a lot of functionalities with their help. Hire developers with experience in important frameworks and libraries.\n\nYou will find it hard to assess this skill when hiring freelance JavaScript developers. It’s not easy to evaluate the real contribution of a freelancer to a project. Hire JavaScript developers from a trusted company like Fwork LLC.\n\n#### C. Make an early decision about hiring full-stack JavaScript developers\n\nDecide early whether you want full-stack JavaScript development. You can then hire full-stack JavaScript developers. Such web developers need Node.js skills for backend development. Node.js developers are in great demand, and you should budget for a hiring lead time. Early decisions about full-stack JS development prepare you well.\n\n#### D. Focus on the important skill requirements of web and/or mobile design and development jobs\n\nYou might be developing web apps or mobile apps. Whether front-end development for web pages or cross-platform mobile development, you should focus on the key requirements. Don’t look for too many skills.\n\nJavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. There’s a large and vibrant JavaScript developer community. This community creates useful open-source tools and frameworks for JavaScript. Therefore, the JavaScript ecosystem is large.\n\nEven the most qualified JavaScript developers don’t know everything in this ecosystem. Clearly identify the specific skills that the software developers should have.\n\n#### E. Evaluate the culture of the company from which you hire a JavaScript developer\n\nAt this point, we assume that you aren’t planning on hiring freelance JavaScript developers anymore. You are hiring JavaScript developers from a software development company. Evaluate the culture of the company keenly.\n\nFreelance JavaScript developers don’t have any close ties with the freelance platform they sign up with. The culture of the freelance platform doesn’t much influence a freelance JavaScript developer. That’s different with dedicated developers. The culture of their company influences them.\n\nLook for software development companies that routinely encourage their developers to upskill. Programmers that routinely learn new programming languages, development frameworks, databases, tools, etc. have better motivation. They contribute more meaningfully to your project.\n\n#### F. Check whether the JavaScript web developers understand architectural decision-making\n\nTop JavaScript developers should understand the importance of architectural decision-making. Web developers should know which architectural pattern fits a type of application.\n\nSoftware developers need to understand which architectural pattern works best for cloud-native application development. They should identify the right architectural pattern for the best performance of web pages.\n\nFull-stack JavaScript developers work on both backend and front-end development. Therefore, they should understand the importance of software architecture in frontend and backend development. Assess this aspect when you interview candidates.\n\n#### G. Full-stack developers should know how to choose the right database\n\nFull-stack JavaScript developers will need to work considerably on API development. They should choose the right database for this. The choice of the database can directly impact the performance and scalability of a web app.\n\nFull-stack developers should know the key [SQL-vs-NoSQL database](https://www.Fwork LLC/blog/sql-vs-nosql-databases/) differences. Furthermore, they should know the differences between different database systems like [MySQL vs MongoDB](https://www.Fwork LLC/blog/mongodb-vs-mysql/). Evaluate their database skills keenly when you interview the developers.\n\n### Examples of questions when interviewing JS developers\n\nAssess the hands-on knowledge of developers. Choose the right interview questions for that. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### A. Provide an example of using JavaScript callback functions.\n\nAnswer: A callback function is called after the execution of another function. The following code snippet is an example:\n\n    function modifyArray(arr, callback) {\n      arr.push(100);\n      callback();\n    }\n    \n    var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    modifyArray(arr, function() {\n      console.log(“array has been modified”, arr);\n    });\n\n#### B. What will be the output of the following code?\n\nCode snippet:\n\n    console.log(false == “0”)\n    console.log(false === “0”)\n    \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe first one will be “true” since “==” is just “equal to”. The second one will be “false” since “===” is “equal to” with a datatype check.\n\n#### C. Show examples of code where you copy an object by reference and by value.\n\n**Answer:** The following code snippet provides the examples:\n\n    a = {‘w’: 1}\n    b = a // copies reference to an object\n    c = Object.assign({},a) // creates new object which copies the value of A\n\nRefer to our JavaScript interview questions for more examples.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWhy don’t you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form? A dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will contact you for a risk-free consultation. This account manager will explain the value that our experienced JavaScript programmers can offer."

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire AngularJS Developers\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWhile it is a very common framework, AngluarJS development does still demand a good level of expertise if you expect to build a fast and reliable application.\n\nThe framework offers a huge number of features that do come with their downsides. Heavy reliance on certain features in a data-heavy web application, for example, will cause it to lag. As such, good AngularJS developers are a must for everything but simple single-page applications.\n\nSo before you even start to hire AngluarJS developers, you need to take a look at your project requirements and think about your long-term business needs.\n\nOne example that is ignored by inexperienced software developers is that of scalability. In the rush to get the product up and running, project owners and their developers often overlook the requirements to scale the application as more and more customers begin to use it.\n\nThis often results in costly additional development costs as developers scramble to fix problems that should never have been made in the first place.\n\nKeep in mind that how you intend to manage the project will depend a lot on its size and the human resources, management tools, and experience already existing in your startup or enterprise company.\n\nOnce you know your project back to front and have a reasonable idea of where you would like it to be a few years from now, it is time to hire AngluarJS developers or an AngularJS development team.\n\nBefore you can onboard any AngularJS developer, you need to know what skills to look out for.\n\n### AngularJS framework skills\n\nAll AngularJS developers need the following skills:\n\n*   A comprehensive understanding of the AngularJS framework including how the different parts work together.\n*   Experience and knowledge working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript in which AngularJS was written. While a derivative of JavaScript, TypeScript is favored for AngularJS development as it helps to reduce bugs while offering a more substantial way to confidently refactor your code. Knowledge in HTML and CSS helps when building interfaces for browsers etc.\n*   Knowledge of the various AngularJS packages and tools. One example is Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) which cuts down on the amount of code you will need to write when configuring your application. It also helps to ensure that your code follows the right standards and so reduces the chance of bugs etc. Other great tools include RxJS, a library for reactive programming, and NPM, which will help you install both AngularJS as well as thousands of support tools.\n*   Git is an indispensable tool for AngularJS development. This excellent program allows you to test out your app and newly built features in the safety of a GIT repository so you don’t need to worry about losing work.\n\nThese are examples of the main skills that all good AngularJS developers must have. If an AngularJS programmer has not mastered all these skills then they are not worth considering.\n\n### Other software development skills\n\nThere are a number of other equally important skills that are essential. These are as follows:\n\n#### A. Application security skills\n\nNo matter what the software product is that you are building, security is a central concern. Even a simple website can lose customer confidence if it gets compromised. For apps that contain sensitive user data such as passwords and credit card details, any security breach can be devastating.\n\nTo ensure your developer has the security skills to prevent this, look for the following:\n\n*   The knowledge of how to avoid security vulnerabilities such as injection, broken authentication, etc.\n*   The understanding of how to secure 1st party APIs.\n*   Knowledge in security systems such as encryption and multi-factor authentication (MFA), etc.\n*   An excellent understanding of coding best practices and pitfalls.\n\n#### B. API development skills\n\nIf you are planning to develop and use your own 1st party APIs then you will need an AngularJS coder who has a good background in API development. A good understanding and how to effectively use existing 3rd party AngularJS APIs is a must even if you don’t plan to develop one for yourself.\n\nRESTful API stands for “Representational State Transfer API”. This is the common framework used for API development so much to be mastered by any API developer. This will give them all the knowledge they need to link your app’s backend functions such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB databases to the frontend.\n\nFinally, developing and integrating APIs is one thing, equally important is that your AngularJS developers are well versed in how to secure your API. Since there are a variety of approaches that vary in suitability and complexity, your developer should have extensive knowledge of security methods such as authentication tokens, digital signature, encryption, quotas, throttling, etc.\n\n#### C. A knowledge of the use of cloud platforms and tools\n\nThe world of software development is rapidly moving towards the cloud. Today, a large number of the applications and services that we use are reliant on cloud-based infrastructure and services.\n\nPaaS platforms such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku facilitate the management of cloud infrastructure, networking, storage, operating system, middleware, and runtime environment to help reduce the burden on your existing infrastructure.\n\nAdded to this, they also offer a range of very useful software development tools that help with everything from creating an API to scalability.\n\n#### D. Code review\n\nAnother extremely important skill is AngularJS code review. Developers with years of experience reviewing other programmers’ code, write better code themselves.\n\nWhile automated tests will identify many code defects, they can’t equal a comprehensive code review by a good AngularJS code reviewer. Look for programmers with as much experience as possible in code reviewing.\n\n#### E. Good communication and team skills\n\nWhile these skill sets might seem obvious, it is amazing how often they are overlooked during the app developers onboarding process. Be sure to do your best to establish how successful your developer has been at working in a team and how good they are at communication.\n\nA big number of project delays and failures are down to communication failure. The more complex the project and the larger the development team, the more important it is that each member of the team is working together coherently.\n\nDevelopers who are able to adapt quickly to your management processes and tools will ensure that your project development goes smoothly.\n\n### How to find the best AngularJS developer?\n\nGiven that you now understand your mobile app development requirements and what the main skills that you need from your AngularJS developers are, you are now ready to start your search.\n\nThe first step is to decide on which type of platform to use.\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire AngularJS developers\n\nNon-industry-specific freelancer sites are an attractive option to product owners that are seeking to add one or two AngularJS developers to their existing development team. However, there are many risks involved in hiring freelancers.\n\nTo start with, they leave the entire onboarding and management process to client companies. They don’t offer any development or management tools, nor are they accountable for the quality of work produced by freelancers.\n\nAnother alternative to the general-purpose freelancer site is the software development-focused freelancer site. Many of these sites do vet their developers to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\nThe main drawback to such sites is that they also don’t offer much in the way of developer management or management tools. Also, keep in mind the location of your developer as managing a developer halfway around the world can be hard due to time zone differences.\n\nThe best option is to hire a developer through a dedicated software development company such as Fwork LLC. We take responsibility for the quality and performance of all of our developers.\n\nWe regularly train all our full-time developers to ensure that they are fully up-to-date with the latest skill sets that are important to their work.\n\nSince all our developers are full-time, they won’t leave your project. If they get sick, we can quickly assign another developer in their place. We have dedicated teams of developers who are training in Agile methodologies etc.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates\n\nOnce you have your candidate shortlist, it is time to start interviewing.\n\nThe interview is where you are going to find the developer or development team that meets all the criteria above.\n\nCheck out our guide on the [best AngularJS interview questions](/hiring-interview-tips/26-angularjs-interview-questions-and-answers/) to ask your potential developer.\n\nDon’t forget to ask to see testimonials.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your application development project\n\nOnce you have found the right developer, you will need to systematically bring them up to speed on all relevant details about your project and their role in it.\n\nBe sure to spend the time and answer any questions that they might have. After this is done, it’s time to introduce them to your team and your processes.\n\nSet up communication channels, show them the management tools that you use to provide project oversight, and get them set up with the relevant development tools such as GitHub.\n\nNow, that this is done, it’s time to get them working.\n\n### Interview tips to hire Angular JS developers\n\nKeep the following tips in mind when you interview Angular developers:\n\n#### A. Pay attention to non-functional requirements (NFRs)\n\nWe talked about scalability already. However, you also need to focus on other NFRs like performance, security, maintainability, testability, etc.\n\nHire Angular developers with experience in complex projects. Project teams need to balance many constraints there. This makes Angular developers in such teams go beyond benchmarks.\n\nThey explore the Angular framework considerably. Programmers can then use Angular JS to great advantage. Such developers can easily meet the NFRs.\n\nFreelance Angular JS developers might not have such experience. This is why we recommend you hire dedicated Angular developers from companies like Fwork LLC. We screen our Angular developers for hire in detail.\n\n#### B. Consider hiring full-stack Angular developers\n\nYou typically want Angular JS for developing the front end of a web app. After all, you have so many other back-end development options for web apps. However, you can think of using JavaScript for the entire gamut of web development. You need to hire Angular developers with full-stack development experience then.\n\nThis approach can deliver many advantages. Take the example of the MEAN stack. “MEAN” stands for MongoDB, Express JS, Angular JS, and Node JS. If you use Node JS for back-end development, then you are using JavaScript for the entire web development.\n\nThe JavaScript ecosystem is large and popular. Many developers know a good deal about it. You could find it easier to hire Angular developers if use JavaScript for the entire project.\n\n#### C. Focus on the code reuse experience\n\nCode reuse can be a great advantage of Angular development. This helps you to gain productivity. However, hiring AngularJS developers with in-depth skills is important for this. Only experienced Angular development teams know the framework and associated libraries in-depth. That knowledge is key for code reuse. This is yet another reason to hire dedicated Angular developers from companies like Fwork LLC.\n\nFurthermore, gaining productivity via code reuse isn’t just a technical effort. You need discussions and collaboration. A dedicated team can bring that to the table. You need leadership and project management support for this. An Angular development company like Fwork LLC provides the entire gamut of AngularJS development services. Such companies can help you gain productivity via code reuse when developing Angular apps.\n\n#### D. Look for the knowledge of coding best practices\n\nYou should hire developers with in-depth knowledge of coding best practices. You can prevent defects that way, which expedites your project. Your development costs remain under control too.\n\nFollowing good coding practices reduces your maintenance costs. You can hire fewer Angular developers for maintenance.\n\nEvaluating the knowledge of coding best practices can be hard. This is yet another reason to hire dedicated Angular developers from Angular development services providers like Fwork LLC. Companies providing Angular development services provide skilled and experienced developers. They do the “heavy lifting” for you as far as screening developers is concerned.\n\n### Examples of coding questions to ask during the interview when hiring AngularJS developers\n\nAsk questions to assess the relevant software development experience. The following are a few examples:\n\n#### A. What does $routeProvider does in AngularJS?\n\n**Answer:** You use it to configure routes in AngularJS apps. E.g., you want to navigate to different sections in a single page application (SPA) without reloading the page. You can accomplish that with $routeProvider.\n\n#### B. How to share data between controllers in AngularJS?\n\n**Answer:** You can share data in the following ways:\n\n*   Creating a service;\n*   Utilizing events;\n*   Using $rootScope;\n*   Using $parent, nextSibling, and controllerAs.\n\n#### C. What does an AngularJS digest cycle do?\n\n**Answer:** The digest cycle in AngularJS helps to implement the two-way data binding. When users make changes, AngularJS updates this change in the model part of the app. AngularJS compares the old values against the new values during the digest cycle. It checks if anything has changed. You use the AngularJS functions named $watch and $digest for this. A digest cycle triggers automatically.\n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nDespite being one of the most popular frameworks, AngularJS development is complex and requires good developers to get it right. Why take the risk of hiring anything but the best AngularJS developers?\n\nFwork LLC is a community of experienced field expert software developers.

					"article": "How to Interview and Hire Meteor Developers\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe creators of this open-source JavaScript web framework developed it using Node.JS. Since Node.JS and JavaScript enjoy significant popularity, many developers know and use them. One of the benefits of Meteor is that it is quite easy to learn for most developers.\n\nThe ease with which Meteor allows rapid prototyping and the development of cross-platform app development makes it very appealing. You can create Android, iOS, and web applications using Meteor. This makes it a cost-effective option for developing mobile applications and web development.\n\nQuite a few JavaScript developers know Meteor. You might think that hiring Meteor programmers would be easy, however, this is far from the case.\n\nIn the first place, you need to choose the right hiring platform. The choice between freelance platforms, freelance platforms that focus on software development, and software development companies needs to be the right one. All have their benefits but some carry heavy risks.\n\nBefore we get into the hiring process, let’s start with the kinds of skills that you will need from your Meteor developer.\n\nYou need to find app developers with the required Meteor development skills, which are as follows:\n\n### Essential Meteor programming skills\n\nYou can think of Meteor as a combination of the following:\n\n*   Node JS, for the server-side business logic.\n*   Blaze/AngularJS/React.JS/Vue, for the front-end user interface (UI).\n*   Cordova, for bridging web pages to mobile views.\n*   MongoDB, for storing data.\n\nMeteor is a full-stack framework like PHP MVC. Meteor Developers are essentially full-stack developers, therefore, they should have the MEAN stack development skills. Look for the following skills:\n\n*   Node.JS;\n*   JavaScript;\n*   MongoDB;\n*   Cross-platform frameworks like Cordova or Ionic;\n*   AngularJS and React.JS;\n*   HTML;\n*   CSS.\n\nYou also need skills in popular RDBMSs like MySQL or PostgreSQL.\n\n### Other skills to look when you hire Meteor JS developers\n\nApart from a great knowledge of programming languages, you need to look for the following additional skills and competencies when hiring a coder to create a Meteor app:\n\n#### A. The knowledge and experience on how to secure web applications\n\nYou will rarely create an app that processes only aggregate and anonymized data like Google Analytics. Your app will likely process sensitive information, therefore, look for programmers that know how to create secure apps. They should know the following:\n\n*   How to identify and mitigate key application security vulnerabilities like injection, broken authentication, etc.\n*   How to use tools and techniques like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, etc.\n\n#### B. The experience of developing 1st party APIs\n\nYou will likely develop 1st party APIs so that the frontend of your app can access the back-end using a consistent framework. Look for a web developer that knows how to develop RESTful APIs. Such a software engineer should know the following:\n\n*   How to use API development and documentation tools.\n*   How to use databases like MySQL or MongoDB to create the backend.\n*   Techniques like authentication tokens, encryption, etc. to secure APIs.\n*   How to design API endpoints and effective rules for requests/responses.\n\n#### C. The knowledge and experience of successful software development projects\n\nA successful web developer with Meteor skills need the following additional skills and competencies:\n\n*   The knowledge of using cloud platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, i.e., the “Platform-as-a-Service” (PaaS) offering from AWS;\n*   The knowledge of coding scalable apps;\n*   Familiarity with common development and source code management tools;\n*   Expertise in the “Model-View-Controller” (MVC) design pattern;\n*   The knowledge of coding in line with the architectural decisions in the project;\n*   The experience of coding in alignment with the user interface (UI) design;\n*   The capability to collaborate with testers, UI designers, and DevOps engineers.\n\n### How to find the best Meteor developers?\n\nYou now need to take the following steps to hire Meteor developers:\n\n#### 1\\. Decide what kind of platform to hire Meteor developers\n\nYou need to choose the right hiring platform for the successful execution of your application development project.\n\nGeneral-purpose freelance platforms can help you to hire Meteor developers. You might be able to hire them at a low rate too, however, hiring freelancers has risks.\n\nFreelancers won’t work full-time in your project since they work on multiple projects. Most freelancer platforms don’t offer any management support or protection of your intellectual property.\n\nAlso, if you are executing the project in the United States, for example, then managing a freelancer based in India can be hard due to time zone differences.\n\nFreelance platforms focused on software development have stringent screening processes that ensure only the top developers join their communities. While this ensures quality, you still need to contend with the risks of managing freelancers.\n\nDedicated software development companies like Fwork LLC are the best option. Not only can we help you to hire full-time Meteor developers, but our transparent and simple development processes are designed to make your life as easy as possible while ensuring project success.\n\nFwork LLC also implements physical, technical, and procedural safeguards such as NDAs to protect your sensitive information.\n\n#### 2\\. Interview the shortlisted candidates for your Meteor JS development project\n\nAfter you choose your hiring platform, you need to interview the shortlisted candidates. You can interview them if you know Meteor sufficiently yourself. Alternatively, get help from a knowledgeable associate or get interview questions from the Internet.\n\nCover all the technical skills we have mentioned. Ask about the complex projects that the candidates have worked on. Find out from them how they have managed the complexities.\n\nExplain your project requirements and ask how they would approach your project. You should expect specific suggestions and recommendations instead of high-level statements.\n\n#### 3\\. Provide detailed information about your app development project\n\nYou need to provide all relevant information about your project to the developer you hire. Provide relevant documentation like requirements, architectural decisions, technical solutions, test plans, etc. Introduce the new developer to your larger team. Explain the roles and responsibilities of the developer and establish a communication process.\n\nProvide access to the technical environment of your project including your code repository. Explain the project plan and iterations. You need to explain the milestone approval process and payment T&Cs clearly.\n\n### Important suggestions for interviewing Meteor developers\n\nThe following interviewing tips will help you to find the top Meteor developers:\n\n#### A. Obtain clarity over the app development scope for directing the hiring effort effectively\n\nAre you developing web apps? Alternatively, do you plan to develop cross-platform mobile apps too? Check for the experience of developing mobile apps in that case. Obtain clarity over the project scope early. This helps you to channel your efforts smartly.\n\n#### B. Assess the skills to avoid variable type-related coding errors\n\nYou need sufficiently experienced developers in a Meteor development team. Remember to build a team with a judicious mix of experienced and junior developers.\n\nMeteor JS utilizes the strengths of JavaScript, which is one of the highly flexible programming languages. JavaScript is dynamically typed. This considerably contributes to its flexibility.\n\nHowever, developers might make variable type-related errors when working with a dynamically typed language. A development team with the right mix of experience can avoid such errors.\n\n#### C. Focus on productivity while developing custom Meteor JS solutions\n\nMeteor JS can offer considerable productivity gains. However, you need developers that know the JavaScript ecosystem well to realize these benefits.\n\nYou could opt for flexible hiring models. E.g., you can hire some developers from freelance platforms and others from a software development company. However, you will find it hard to judge the skills of freelancers during interviews.\n\nInstead, we recommend you hire developers from trustworthy software companies like Fwork LLC. Our vetting process helps you to get only skilled, experienced, and motivated developers.\n\n### Examples of interview questions when hiring Meteor JS developers\n\nAssess the relevant Meteor JS development experience of candidates. Ask questions that help you to do so. A few examples are as follows:\n\n#### A. State the default file loading order in Meteor.\n\n**Answer:** The default file loading order in Meteor is as follows:\n\nHTML template files are loaded first.  \nFiles inside any “lib/” directory are loaded subsequently.  \nAfter this, files with deeper paths are loaded.  \nSubsequently, files are loaded in alphabetical order of the entire path.  \nFinally, files beginning with “main.” are loaded.\n\n#### B. List the special directories in Meteor.\n\n**Answer:** The special directories in Meteor are as follows:\n\n“imports”;  \n“node\\_modules”;  \n“client”;  \n“server”;  \n“public”;  \n“private”;  \n“client/compatibility”;  \n“tests”.\n\n#### C. Write a code snippet to show the usage of MongoDB collections in Meteor.\n\n**Answer:** The following code snippet shows how you can use MongoDB collections in Meteor:\n\n    TestCollection = new Mongo.Collection ('TestCollection');\n    var testData = {\n      key1: \"test 1\",\n      key2: \"test 2\"\n    }\n    TestCollection.insert(testData);\n    \n\n### Submit a Project With Zero Risk\n\nWe recommend that you take a few minutes and fill this [Fwork LLC product specification](https://dashboard.Fwork LLC/get-started) form. A dedicated account manager from Fwork LLC will get in touch to explain the benefits you can get if you work with our experienced Meteor developers and unique development process."
